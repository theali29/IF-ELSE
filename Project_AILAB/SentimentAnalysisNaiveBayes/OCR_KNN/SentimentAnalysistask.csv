Negative,"My last two BLU phones were alright, but none carried the 4g LTE speed. And now, I finally have the Studio C 5+5 LTE to give me the speed and storage space I need!"
Negative,Very nice budget phone with plenty of features. However it is missing a compass.
Negative,"phone stop charging in one month,i contacted BLU and advised they said since the screen was broken it void warranty,even though i dropped it after 2 weeks of no charging and another battery,it is cheap garbage stay away from BLU"
Negative,Full HD image!
Negative,"damaged cell came the battery is not charging , always at 0% , thus can not use the computer, I can do about it , I am very unhappy"
Negative,Absolutely loving the Blu's. They are great.
Negative,I bought the phone as a Christmas gift for my oldest son & he loves it.
Negative,Phone started messing up soon as i got it. It won't let me use the bottom corner of the screen.
Negative,Gave as a give since the original person who ordered it changed their mind.
Negative,"This phone is substandard at best! Constantly reboots, and locks up requiring restart. Holds an underwhelming # of apps. Would not buy or recommend."
Negative,I am pleased thanks
Negative,Love the phone
Negative,This phone is an ok model but the storage is crappy.. It freezes every now and then
Negative,recommended
Negative,This Is An Horrible Phone It Messed Up Within A Weeks Time..
Negative,THE BEST FOR ITS TYPE AND LONG HOURS DURATION
Negative,"Well, I ordered this phone to replace my Galaxy S3 that I broke after 2 yrs. working construction. This phone was delivered to my hotel out of town in 24 hrs by amazon, awesome customer service, While the screen and cameras aren't as good as my samsung, the are very good. The build quality of the phone seems excellent after 1 month. I appreciate the lack of bloatware on the phone. When I got home and showed it to my wife, I had to order her one since its unlocked and works in the Dominican Republic(she has a Galaxy 4). In short , its a great phone, lots of quality at a very low price. I would of ordered one of their LTE phones but they had a backlog at the time. Go BLU, great quality at a great price! At this price compared to buying a phone from T Mobile or ATT, I can have a new phone every year at an affordable price!"
Negative,"This is my 3rd BLU phone, Love the good value. Takes great photos"
Negative,Good b√°sic Phone
Negative,I both this phone for somebody and it works great thanks for the case and screen protector. Will definately buy again .
Negative,while in use or stand by this phone will be warm or hot killing the battery mine died with in 2-3 hours or just sitting there doing nothing from fully charged to dead I don't thing its the battery I think is the phone is just a power hog even while in stand by its still draining the battery and is always hot do not buy this phone also the 8 gb is a lie there is only 3.11gb available to use
Negative,"I hate this thing so much i gave it to my brother in law when he dropped his in the toilet. I hoped he would continue the trend but no, he just uses it for work or whatever."
Negative,Great phone
Negative,I am really impressed with how this phone works. For a cheap phone it really does have a lot of pricey features.It is super slim. Comes with a silicone case to protect the cornersThe speaker phone is loud which is nice because I use it a lot.It is android based. Has a decent camera. fast enough processor. If you are a tech junkie that has to have the best of the best this is not for you. But if you like to play simple games and use apps like Facebook this phone is perfect for the price.I could not be happier and this is the type of phone that I will continue to buy and save my big bucks for more important things.
Negative,excellet phone
Negative,I had no problems using it out of the country.Will buy it again when traveling to Africa
Negative,Good so far
Negative,excellent phone
Negative,Amazing phone especially for the price. I love it and use it in my AT&T plan.
Negative,"I am a Georgia Resident (USA) and T-mobile User.. I am tired of paying ridiculous prices for new phones and having them break all the time. Warranty is too expensive and only cover a couple of times. And half the time buying an older or used phone it ends up having something bad that I didn't know until long time use or it dies on you. So I though I would give this a try. The quality of these phones are actually decent and they work really well. They do not have the Bloatware (T-mobile apps, AT&T Apps, Verizon Apps, Etc) that most phones and thus makes it seem fairly fast. Long time I am not sure how long these will last but at a range of $200 or $300 for some, it is not life or death if they fall and break as compared to those $600-700 phones that you get in the store. This one in particular made it good for the screen size, similar to my S6 Edge. The only difference is quality in screen but it is still fairly different. If you are trying to the latest phone, at half the price, just compare the specs of these phones (RAM, PROCESSOR, STORAGE, BATTERY SIZE, ETC.)"
Negative,Worth for money
Negative,I can not get Facebook to download. I keep getting error 504. The whole reason I got the phone was for Facebook. By by blu.
Negative,great
Negative,"Very nice phone! Good quality for the price! Good size, speed, battery, apps, etc."
Negative,I really loved this cellphone
Negative,I'm not sure about this phone but I had to send it back because I could not hear when ppl called me the earpiece vol is very low even when I turned it up to the max
Negative,"I give 5 stars because the performance of this phone is excellent having in consideration the price,LTE,OS lollipop ,fast respons etc.No complaint for battery and camera didn't expected first quality for the price I paid"
Negative,This phone sucks..the ear piece is low...the battery is terrible... The key board is just said ...when u trying to enter a card number or even when texting it types n the wrong letter or number...I'm scared to purchase another ...do anyone have and idea brands to buy for straight talk services I had this phone for two months now the speakers out smh
Negative,Nice phone
Negative,"This phone has a nice large screen, camera is good, speaker is phenomenal. The phone is pretty (not important but still worth mentioning). It comes with a protective case that is color coordinated to the phone. It comes with a screen protector. This phone is absolutely wonderful especially for the low price. I would definitely recommend this phone, and am considering buying another as I bought this for my daughter. If you are budget minded and want a nice phone for a pay as you go or no contract plan this is the ticket!!!"
Negative,awesome phone love it and highly recommended to buy this product.
Negative,This phone suck! !!
Negative,beautiful and working good
Negative,"Packaged well, easy to use, so far, so great!"
Negative,"Love phone. Easy to work. Haven't had chance to get straight talk yet, so will have to see bout any issues regarding this."
Negative,Excelent
Negative,Just great
Negative,I love the phone üòç
Negative,So far so good. Love the video and sound quality! Fast and easy. Pictures look great but im not a picrure fanatic either. But the touch screen is hard. Have to tap multiple times. Overall well worth it for my budget.
Negative,Top demais recomendo
Negative,"I purchase it for my friend, she like it alot thanks."
Negative,Great phone for less money. Why get an apple or Samsung device when this will do everything.
Negative,"Here goes a realistic review:I spent approximately 2 weeks researching a budget friendly replacement to my iPhone 5s that took a swim with me. I am over making payments to a device that needs warranties and all sorts of addons so an Android phone in the range of $50-$150 seems reasonable.I looked into EVERY brand from Nokia, LG, Motorola, Chinese brands, and finally the American company BLU. To be honest, I was trying to avoid BLU. I felt as if since it were an American manufacturer supported heavily by Amazon that there was some sort of catch. A lot of reviews I read for other BLU devices also scared me by talking about OS malfunctions and poor performance. This is the only BLU phone with excellent reviews across the board in my budget range.Here's my thoughts so far. The device looks fantastic and runs the latest version of Android, which isn't terrible coming from a long time iOS user. I will say that the hardware in this 5"" phone makes it operate smoothly. With an extra gigabyte of RAM it could be even better but being that its a sub $100 phone it's great! I spent the first few minutes uninstalling the Amazon Apps (obvious partnership) and configuring the settings to my liking.PRO:- 5"" display with good resolution and OK brightness- Smooth interface with little lag or freezing- Lightweight- Acceptable placement of volume and power buttons, although I think there are better places to put them- Dual SIM for both personal and business lines which can have different ringtone settings for each.- Excellent Bluetooth connectivity- Comes with a case and screen protector as well as the standard charging accessories. All quality material.CON:- Battery life is not to my liking. I fixed this by keeping the phone on a lower brightness setting. It seems this is the major cause of battery loss.- Needs an aftermarket APP for the camera. The default camera app is OK but the image quality is fairly low even in optimal light. An aftermarket APP made this problem go away and luckily can be set as the ""default"" so the better APP can be launched from the lock screen.- Notifications: This phone likes to tell you everything it's thinking about. It alerts you every time it drops a percentage down of battery from 10% to 1%. I couldn't find anywhere on the web or within the phone settings to stop notifying me. Not a huge con but more of an annoyance.Conclusion:I'm a person who needs a phone for calls, texting, email and the occasional web browsing. I'm not too sure if this is the phone for games and tons of use but this phone is fantastic at it's price point. I would recommend this product to anyone in need of a cost effective smartphone."
Negative,first week awesome after that phone would lose charge fast and soon stopped charging all together
Negative,The product came faster than expected and I recommend it.
Negative,everything was as expected
Negative,"Not a good buy for me, have to return it to Amazon. I tried buying a TMobile or ATT sim card on line and after entering the IMEI number received the message that the IMEI isn't valid and that the device is unusable and I should buy another device."
Negative,"Incredible, it exceeded expectations. 5 stars..."
Negative,"I purchase it for my friend, she like it alot thanks."
Negative,"very happy with the product, price and shipping"
Negative,A very good stock Android
Negative,Id like to send back
Negative,purchased for my husband and he is really pleased with it!
Negative,Power button fell off after a month.
Negative,Excellent value.
Negative,excelente
Negative,Does well for sub-$100 phone. Nice look and feel for the price.
Negative,8Gb internal memory is a lye. It has little more than 3Gb.
Negative,Excellent
Negative,Great Seller! Excelent Smartphone!
Negative,Worth for money
Negative,"This phone is s***. The layout already is bad, with the keyboard taking up over half of the screen when you use it. You will most likely have to search around and find a keyboard app with a smaller keyboard. Secondly, this phone's touch response is way off. For example, in Snapchat you can forget about drawing letters, or anything for that matter. This fluke also effects your typing ESPECIALLY if you have Swype on so typing anything will take 10x longer. I normally use excellent grammar and spelling but this phone has reduced me to using slang like ""r u"" and ""2morro"" because it's just not worth the stress trying to type a nice message. Also, this phone's battery heats up very quickly, which makes the phone crap out. This phone already is very glitchy, so someone with little patience should definitely not buy it!!! Once the battery heats up though, it gets much worse. Sometimes this phone even shuts itself off. Over all, this phone is just terrible, and not a good investment unless you're ready to pony up more money in a few months for a better phone when this one drives you insane."
Negative,I am very disappointed in this phone I have had three and they are all bad says 4glte it's never had LTE it takes 18-24hrs to download an app
Negative,Good
Negative,It is a good product for the rate it is offered on. At this rate there are no other mobiles that offer these features. Also the mobile is really good.
Negative,"This phone is OK. My only problem is that the charger does not work right, and the power button doesn't work ...every time I need to view my messages an push the power button it doesn't turn on always have to plug into charger real quick than take out to see the screen light up ...but it died completely an its says fully charge but when I need to turn on the phone by holding down on the power button it isn't turning on ...."
Negative,very good phone
Negative,"I've litterally had to get a replacment, because the phone would literally stop working on Facebook, and the browser. This happened so much, that I consistently called my phone carrier AT&T to see if this phone was really compatible with my carrier. Turns out it is. Back to the point though, the phone literally would stop working throughout the day, that I literally have to cut of the data connection 2x, then power it off/back on. This is constantly having. Even so with my replacement. Is it only the white Blu Studio C 5+5 that's acting up. Does the black Studio C 5+5 by far work better than the other colors? Or is it just the white one that's messed up, and the rest works perfectly fine. Just not white.Pls respond back to my last question guys. ""Does the black Blu studio C 5+5 work better than the white Blu studio C 5+5?"""
Negative,"Love this phone! Very quick response, beautiful screen. Comes with a screen protector and slim style case both were easy to install. Hoping Amazon will stock the BLU cases for this model."
Negative,I love my phone
Negative,Pretty good phone üëç
Negative,Works great
Negative,It is as expected and better. Thanks
Negative,I love this phone. It does all I want at half the cost of the big name phones.
Negative,"Got this to replace my old BLU Advance that quit. This phone is big and it's really easy to see the screen. The camera is also a lot better than on the old phone.By the way, BLU stands by their products. I called BLU customer service and they offered to fix my old phone since it was still under the 1 yr warranty. I sent it in and they couldn't repair it, so the sent me a free new replacement! I bought this new one anyway, since I wanted a bigger, better phone. But now we have a smartphone that my kids can play apps on without bothering with mine."
Negative,excellent product fast shipping
Negative,Purchased two of these a month ago. So far so good. Works excellent for the price
Negative,"Pone cannot share internet services without the use of mini usb. Speed dialing is headache.(Butt dialing all the time).Picture quality is appalling. Easy to get dirty, Sound fluctuates, I will not recommend this product unless you cannot afford a better phone."
Negative,Cool!
Negative,"Excelente, I love this cellphone"
Negative,Phone crashed after 2 weeks.
Negative,while in use or stand by this phone will be warm or hot killing the battery mine died with in 2-3 hours or just sitting there doing nothing from fully charged to dead I don't thing its the battery I think is the phone is just a power hog even while in stand by its still draining the battery and is always hot do not buy this phone also the 8 gb is a lie there is only 3.11gb available to use
Negative,"Excellent Phone!!!! Love It!!! Has all the newest features, great battery life. Very fast speed time on any search!!! Awesome Camera!! Love the extra features!!! Perfect Pitcutes!!!"
Negative,"i purchased this phone Aug.31 and it said it came with a 1yr warranty. The battery will not hold charge currently and ive tried sending it back have no luck like the warranty does not exist anymore, i am highly upset about this issue, do not buy"
Negative,I'm very happy with this phone. The button on the side feels a little odd at first but other than that it reminds me of Samsung Galaxy S3 which I loved but couldn't transfer from boost to att. I hate all the go phones from ATT but I like the service . This phone is a great replacement for it and for the price you can't beat that. The android system is really good and customizable. I like that it has two sim slots. I'm thinking about getting a second sim for international calls. So far I'm liking this phone a lot.
Negative,I really love my phone it's perfect for me
Negative,Good b√°sic Phone
Negative,"Horrible phone. Very lagging! My son could not stand the phone after 1 week, we had to return it and bought a Samsung S5."
Negative,"I love this phone! I ordered the seafoam green color and it is beautiful. I got the lavender purple and white hard case too. It can play almost any app, the ones that don't work are super high memory, which is the only drawback with the 8 gb storage. You will need an SD card as most of the internal storage is for the system Operations and Google apps. It came with a screen protector, mines lasted since I bought it. It came with a silicone case but I also ordered the case separately from BLU. The hard case with rubbery protective layer will not fit over the jelly case though. It has protected my phone from breaking many times now. This phone is still working great. The only problem I had was with an BLU system update. I contacted them and they were helpful but the only solution left was doing a hard reset. Good thing everything backs up to Google and my SIM card, it made it easy to make it my old phone again. I would highly recommend this phone. It is cheap but not at all cheap quality and does more than I would expect with a cheap phone."
Negative,Good so far
Negative,excellent phone. battery hard enough and not overheat.
Negative,excellent phone
Negative,"Very nice phone! Good quality for the price! Good size, speed, battery, apps, etc."
Negative,great cell!
Negative,Phone started messing up soon as i got it. It won't let me use the bottom corner of the screen.
Negative,Gave as a give since the original person who ordered it changed their mind.
Negative,"Poor man samsung galaxy or htc phone. A good Android phone pretty much do everything as the high end phone. With this devices you can choose any carrier you like without a expensive contract, started at $20 a month. I had purchased more than four different blu phone ."
Negative,Great phone so far..Hubby loves it..
Negative,I got this phone on Friday. I am looking for a new phone already .Very bad phone .The review was good that why I bought it never again
Negative,I love this phone. A few of my close friends and family saw it liked it. The features and the price a big sell.
Negative,Love this phone they even have it all n my favorite color pink happy customer
Negative,very nice phone bundle. was gift . person very happy. he inserted his sim card from his phone that was damaged and this one started right up
Negative,"When I ordered this, the description mentioned that it was missing a small rubber cover. No big deal. It didn't say that the screen was malfunctioning so severely that it's quite difficult to use, or that it crashes all the time. I've now ordered a different phone and will consign this one to the garbage."
Negative,"Well worth the money, love phone and great reception, meets all my needs."
Negative,"This phone complete crap chiiinnaaa. phone,1st month battery reduce to 3 hrs standby ,picture solution very bad and after 5 months completed not charge any more !! Highly recommend DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE.Try it if you don't mind wasting your Money."
Negative,"I hate this thing so much i gave it to my brother in law when he dropped his in the toilet. I hoped he would continue the trend but no, he just uses it for work or whatever."
Negative,I can't say enough good things about this phone. Performance is excellent and the quality vs cost is undeniably one of its best features!!!
Negative,I am really impressed with how this phone works. For a cheap phone it really does have a lot of pricey features.It is super slim. Comes with a silicone case to protect the cornersThe speaker phone is loud which is nice because I use it a lot.It is android based. Has a decent camera. fast enough processor.

Negative,A very good stock Android
Negative,I was wondering is if this phone works for straight talk phones
Negative,Very disappointed.... Had this phone only 6 days and now it wont charge....just sent it back...i don't recommend it
Negative,"Perfect phone for the price, check out my review video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYYi4YHtPQYYou will not be disappointed in this phone! For a sub $100 phone, I am highly impressed and I think I will be sticking with BLU from now on!Thank you guys for making a great affordable phone!"
Negative,I'm not sure about this phone but I had to send it back because I could not hear when ppl called me the earpiece vol is very low even when I turned it up to the max
Negative,"Let me start by saying the look & feel of the phone was exceptional. I thought I had struck gold with this phone. But I was new to a Android operating system ( I own a I-pad and love the simplicity of the O.S. and it provided me with a rude awakening of what was in store. The ""owners manual"" is one sheet of paper and it starts off with the premise that the ""as delivered"" configuration of the phone need not be explained or instructions need not be provided. hence the phone would only remain ""on"" for a few seconds and then promptly shut down. being ""new "" to Android environment made my situation worse. I did reach ""tech support"" of my cell carrier who markets this phone hoping for some on-line assistance. The person told me I could clear any settings and put the phone in ""OEM"" baseline configuration by a simultaneous manipulation of the power key and some other key which I cannot recall. Doing this did not re-boot the phone as promised - but rather caused the screen to rapidly flash on and off - over and over. When I asked the tech support was this ""normal"" he replied that the phone had ""a total failure"" and was now totally useless. He implied that this was not the first time that this had occurred with this model of the Blu phone. Such a beautiful phone stuck with such poor user manual."
Negative,This phone is an ok model but the storage is crappy.. It freezes every now and then
Negative,Id like to send back
Negative,"First of all I would to say Thank you for the awesome and prompt delivery as estimate. This was the second attempt to buy and give to my mom that live overseas and would live soon..Had trouble get it for for the first time with another seller, in which guaranteeded to get the phone in two days and never seen it. But anyways, The second attempt was just great, had my package on the next day! THANK YOUUU Again!Second, the phone is just amazing so far, loved all the featuresthat the phone has it, and now we are considering to switch up our iphones and Galaxy note to it. Very affordable, great phone, comes with a case and screen protector! So glad I had bought this phone!"

Negative,Read reviews over and over for different phones. This was a Christmas present. She loves it. We wanted all the features of the phone but didn't want to spend a small fortune on a phone for 14 yr old. I was surprised when I got it. Very well made phone and it comes with everything needed.

Negative,"Here goes a realistic review:I spent approximately 2 weeks researching a budget friendly replacement to my iPhone 5s that took a swim with me. I am over making payments to a device that needs warranties and all sorts of addons so an Android phone in the range of $50-$150 seems reasonable.I looked into EVERY brand from Nokia, LG, Motorola, Chinese brands, and finally the American company BLU.

Negative,"This is a great phone at an incredible price. This phone is worth 5 times more. I am amazed about the quality of the phone, it does not feel cheap at all. It runs smoothly,the screen is bright and colorful. Android L is the best yet. Now, for those who like to leave bad reviews, you should take in consideration that this is a $90 cellphone before comparing it to any other overrated, overpriced phone. This phone will beat them any day of the week. Before complaining about the ""crappy"" cam, make sure you peel the protective plastic off the lens. If you are nostalgic about a certain brand, you should stick with them and not write bad reviews about this brand. If you like to throw your money away on overpriced phones it's ok. I am getting the best value and a better experience than you."
Negative,"the only thing with these is after about 6 months of using, the screen would constantly keep freezing and sometimes blackout"

I hate all the go phones from ATT but I like the service . This phone is a great replacement for it and for the price you can't beat that. The android system is really good and customizable. I like that it has two sim slots. I'm thinking about getting a second sim for international calls. So far I'm liking this phone a lot.
Negative,Excelent
Negative,I love the phone üòç
Negative,"Love this phone! Very quick response, beautiful screen. Comes with a screen protector and slim style case both were easy to install. Hoping Amazon will stock the BLU cases for this model."
Negative,I can`t t believe such a great phone costs less then $ 100! I`m using it for one week now and have no complains at all! I fully recommend it with no doubts!
Negative,Nice phone
Negative,Do not order this phone in the USA it only works on 2g.
Negative,"Incredible, it exceeded expectations. 5 stars..."
Negative,"When I ordered this, the description mentioned that it was missing a small rubber cover. No big deal. It didn't say that the screen was malfunctioning so severely that it's quite difficult to use, or that it crashes all the time. I've now ordered a different phone and will consign this one to the garbage."
Negative,"This phone freezes up..The keyboard words sticks , it take me 5 minutes to send a 3 word texts."
Negative,"Don't want to go through the trouble of returning it but I should. The signal is always in and out, and none of my Bluetooth devices are able to connect to this model. This isn't my first BLU phone but ALL I can really say is I for sure got what I paid for this time around! I'm not big on phones or tech and I still wouldn't recommend this phone to anyone."
Negative,"In realitty, it doesn't even deserve a 1. I can't stand this phone and I feel I just wasted my money."
Negative,Love this phone they even have it all n my favorite color pink happy customer
Negative,excellent phone
Negative,Wonderful phone. Exactly what my wife wanted. Packaging was great. Very safe in transit.
Negative,I just got it and i like it it's not to big
Negative,Great phone. I haven't had any problems so far!
Negative,first week awesome after that phone would lose charge fast and soon stopped charging all together
Negative,"I give 5 stars because the performance of this phone is excellent having in consideration the price,LTE,OS lollipop ,fast respons etc.No complaint for battery and camera didn't expected first quality for the price I paid"
Negative,"This phone is substandard at best! Constantly reboots, and locks up requiring restart. Holds an underwhelming # of apps. Would not buy or recommend."
Negative,This is the right phone for me
Negative,"A fantastic battery life. Read on reviews about this, but until I actually purchased and saw for myself, had trouble believing."
Negative,Works Perfectly
Negative,to many problems from the beginning . Not what i was expecting with all theglorifying they said about it.
Negative,Good works grate
Negative,"I am a Georgia Resident (USA) and T-mobile User.. I am tired of paying ridiculous prices for new phones and having them break all the time. Warranty is too expensive and only cover a couple of times. And half the time buying an older or used phone it ends up having something bad that I didn't know until long time use or it dies on you. So I though I would give this a try. The quality of these phones are actually decent and they work really well. They do not have the Bloatware (T-mobile apps, AT&T Apps, Verizon Apps, Etc) that most phones and thus makes it seem fairly fast. Long time I am not sure how long these will last but at a range of $200 or $300 for some, it is not life or death if they fall and break as compared to those $600-700 phones that you get in the store. This one in particular made it good for the screen size, similar to my S6 Edge. The only difference is quality in screen but it is still fairly different. If you are trying to the latest phone, at half the price, just compare the specs of these phones (RAM, PROCESSOR, STORAGE, BATTERY SIZE, ETC.)"
Negative,Worth for money
Negative,exelente
Negative,kool phone
Negative,Top demais recomendo
Negative,Great phone for less money. Why get an apple or Samsung device when this will do everything.
Negative,"This phone came right on time! So, far the phone doesn't send or receive pictures. But overall it's a great phone."
Negative,"Let me start by saying the look & feel of the phone was exceptional. I thought I had struck gold with this phone. But I was new to a Android operating system ( I own a I-pad and love the simplicity of the O.S. and it provided me with a rude awakening of what was in store. The ""owners manual"" is one sheet of paper and it starts off with the premise that the ""as delivered"" configuration of the phone need not be explained or instructions need not be provided. hence the phone would only remain ""on"" for a few seconds and then promptly shut down. being ""new "" to Android environment made my situation worse. I did reach ""tech support"" of my cell carrier who markets this phone hoping for some on-line assistance. The person told me I could clear any settings and put the phone in ""OEM"" baseline configuration by a simultaneous manipulation of the power key and some other key which I cannot recall. Doing this did not re-boot the phone as promised - but rather caused the screen to rapidly flash on and off - over and over. When I asked the tech support was this ""normal"" he replied that the phone had ""a total failure"" and was now totally useless. He implied that this was not the first time that this had occurred with this model of the Blu phone. Such a beautiful phone stuck with such poor user manual."
Negative,EXCELLENT PHONE
Negative,Wouldn't allow me to accept multimedia messages and people on the other end couldn't hear me.
Negative,Great phone! Quick delivery and you cant beat the price! Works just like my galaxy but way cheaper!
Negative,"Got this to replace my old BLU Advance that quit. This phone is big and it's really easy to see the screen. The camera is also a lot better than on the old phone.By the way, BLU stands by their products. I called BLU customer service and they offered to fix my old phone since it was still under the 1 yr warranty. I sent it in and they couldn't repair it, so the sent me a free new replacement! I bought this new one anyway, since I wanted a bigger, better phone. But now we have a smartphone that my kids can play apps on without bothering with mine."
Negative,"Awesome smart phone. Runs lightning quick, surprisingly durable, looks decent and best of all TONS of memory and no pre-loaded garbage or restrictions."
Negative,Excellent phone. üëçüëçüëç
Negative,"This really is a great phone at a great price. It comes with enough apps to get you started without overloading your entire memory with junk. I'm using the same net10 SIM card I had in my iPhone 4 . I also added 32gb sd card for additional storage.There is no reason, in my opinion to pay hundreds of dollars when the quality is right here in BLU. I am very happy with my new phone and when I'm shopping for my husbands next phone, I will be looking at BLU first."
Negative,"I love this phone, great for the price. I bought one for myself then purchased another for my son. Good phone, cool colors..received very quickly!!!"
Negative,"Love it! Got here pretty fast and it looks great! I ordered gold. The keyboard problem people have been having can be easily fixed by going to language and input and turning the pointer speed up and recalibrating the touch sensor. Camera flash is a bit bright and really isn't even necessary, it takes GREAT pictures with the selfie cam! I will include the selfie and update the post with pictures of the phone later. Overall great for what you pay! And looks better in person!"
Negative,I am really impressed with how this phone works. For a cheap phone it really does have a lot of pricey features.It is super slim. Comes with a silicone case to protect the cornersThe speaker phone is loud which is nice because I use it a lot.It is android based. Has a decent camera. fast enough processor. If you are a tech junkie that has to have the best of the best this is not for you. But if you like to play simple games and use apps like Facebook this phone is perfect for the price.I could not be happier and this is the type of phone that I will continue to buy and save my big bucks for more important things.
Negative,Love it
Negative,"So far I love it! Its fast, cameras are great, good speaker, just all around amazing quality!"
Negative,Very good product fast delievery
Negative,excellent product fast shipping
Negative,"This phone freezes up..The keyboard words sticks , it take me 5 minutes to send a 3 word texts."
Negative,"First of all I would to say Thank you for the awesome and prompt delivery as estimate. This was the second attempt to buy and give to my mom that live overseas and would live soon..Had trouble get it for for the first time with another seller, in which guaranteeded to get the phone in two days and never seen it.

Negative,"Great and inexpensive smart phone, really nice looking and compares to more expensive brands on the market. Came with Lollipop 5.0 Android and says 64 GB micro SD, but I inserted and am using a 128 GB with no problems. Initial setup allows to install mirror image of another device like my android tablet copied all the apps so I didn't have to load again for phone. Works fast, 4G and because it was unlocked, I could get the best Unlimited plan with Smart Talk. Very happy and you will be too."
Negative,I was told it was straight talk compatibility. When I went to transfer my number over to this one. They told me it wasn't with straight talk. Sending this one back.

Negative,"If I could give it less than a star, I would. Horrible phone. Keyboard is extremely unresponsive, and when it does respond, it puts random letters up. I can no longer access my voicemail on this phone no matter what I do. Call quality is awful, everyone I talk to cannot hear me unless I essentially scream, which is wonderful in public. Nome of the apps are reliable in staying open for any period of time, they randomly close whenever they please. This is an issue with ALL my apps, so I know it isn't the app. Also, the WiFi refuses to pick up signal, even when I'm sitting beside someone onnthe same WiFi as I'm supposedly connected to. The internet, both tr browser app and chrome app, rarely load pages. I spent 100 bucks on this phone and have had better phones for 40!"

Primary SIM is full size and the secondary SIM is Micro size. Comes with TPU gel case, screen protector, charger, usb cable and headphone/handsfree microphone. Runs Android 4.4.2, has English Spanish and Portuguese support."
Negative,excelente
Negative,good cel
Negative,"very good for the money, I use it as an extra phone when going abroad"
Negative,"I feel obligated to write this review. Now, looking at the other reviews, I am confused. The phone either hugely diminished in quality, or people just had vastly different experiences. The phone feels very cheap first of all, due to the plastic cover. Although it is nice of Blu to provide a case (although this just becomes annoying from the amount of times you have to take out the battery since the cover comes off with the case).However, the phone's start up was extremely inconvenient. The worst I've ever had with any phone. When it started up, the phone was extremely slow. It took several minutes for it to do anything. Several apps did not work, I was unable to get to the settings without the phone shutting off. The phone itself often froze and was unresponsive. I had to take the battery out several times. The Google play store also did not work for several hours.Worst of all, the phone was unable to recognize my SD card and instead deleted all of its contents. The wifi is also terrible and disconnects frequently.I hate to write this negative review because I genuinely thought this phone would be a steal due to the several reviews online I watched on Youtube. However, I doubt anyone conducting these video reviews actually used the phone regularly. Also, any credible website gives this phone around a 3.8-4.3 out of 10. I returned this phone and bought a different phone for the $120 range. It was worth it."
Negative,Excelente
Negative,I Love IT
Negative,"Great phone, amazing. The reduced ppi and graphics and kit kat make the processor and ram well suited, Coming from a nexus 5 I don't really notice the pixels, or a difference in processor, or battery life differences with daily use. Applications like Maps will drop frames and the touch sensitivity could be more precise ecspecially with gestures, camera is behind nexus 5 but that camera is amazing. This is a Great Phone!!!! Blu is MBA education in action and done right. Thank you. Great phone, great price point."
Negative,"All we have acquired smartphone BLU brand, we know that we are excellent devices, particularly recommend."
Negative,"One of the worst phones i've ever had. except for the fact that it is purple - which is what i wanted - it is a complete waste of money. doesn't work properly, is extremely slow, turns off by itself, it is also hard to navigate, not user-friendly at all. doesn't function properly with apps, stops certain apps or logs out of them for no reason. don't like it."
Negative,"I've rated with one star because I received the phone a different color I bought. And it's unfair because I was so happy waiting for my phone and sent me what color you want and not the one I choose when purchasing.However, avoiding the big mistake, is a great phone, it's fast. ultra slim, luxurious design, lightweight, beautiful phone. and all at a great price, and that makes me very happy. They can buy the phone will not be disappointed, it is a good choice.I'm just disappointed not to receive the color of the phone I bought.Yes I am paying for a product and choose the color,it is expected to receive the selected product, not the one you want.I don't make a return the phone, because I live in Venezuela and I would very expensive to do that.I hope that next buy, you are more careful with their customers.and you can hopefully compensate me. Thank you.I am amazed!It is a great phone.Good performance.It's fast , design is nice, is lightweight,and has everything we want from a phone at a great price."

The delivery was fast. We have Amanzon Prime (worth the money) and the expected delivery was Thursday and it came in on Monday. Awesome! In the box was a charger, headphones, a see through gel case, and the phone. And it came in a hard plastic box....that's an added plus. It is truly unlocked. My daughter has Walmart Family talk- tmobile and it works perfectly. Great signal. Now one thing to remember is this is not a HD phone so resolution isn't the best but I have an LG G2 and I can barely tell the difference. I'm thinking about getting one to replace it.....I will tell more once I've had it about a week or so...."

Negative,"It started as an ideal bargain for my buck, after reading some of the generated reviews I came to an conclusion, the product ain't all that bad to say to be presented as an gift, but about three weeks inside, it was like ""nightmare before Christmas"", it began to malfunction in every way possible, some of few, it just turns itself on or off @ any given time, when do comes on, it's like the app are not loaded properly, well the receiver grew utterly impatient only for him to carry the unit by an agent, to be told it was an refurbished item, so buyers beware, especially items from Power Hobby"
Negative,"Ordered 2 Blue Studio c mini's on Jan. 24 both worked fine for 5 weeks. Now both won't keep a charge. Cannot perform various functions.Battery goes dead in matter of minutes. I am not happy. Spent approximately 200 dollars. Now I have to buy 2 new phones after 5 weeks. Order date Jan 24. Order # 111-3069042-2412254. My name Carmine Sanecchiaro. Email snooky1142@msn.com. I have bought many products from you. If you can not do anything, I will never buy anything from you again. I do not want to tell you how I really feel. It is not very nice."

Negative,Great stuff easy to follow
Negative,Exellent
Negative,"I give this phone a 5 star rating,because it stays charged all day.I play games, search the net and receive calls,the phone has very clear reception."
Negative,"Apparently BlU phones in general are junk made to be disposable in a few months. Bought 1st BlU phone, lasted about 7 months and died. Bought this phone in august 2014 to replace it. Guess what? It died 2 days ago, just past the 6 month mark. This means I have spent over $350 on Blu phones in just over a year. Might as well buy a better phone to start with. You say warranty? read the fine print closely. Sent in the first phone, but even though it had just died and would not boot, it was claimed to be ""damaged"" and would cost more to fix than buying another one. The phone was never misused or abused. Useless warranty."
Negative,had issues gettig itbset up with straight talk then by my fault it fell out of my pocket into the toilet. it was in there 4 seconds and was ruined. i dropped my LG in a toilet and guess what that one still works fine. basically i feel they are cheaply made and will not buy one ever again.
Negative,excellent

Negative,Is beautiful!
Negative,"A very good option in BLU's line of Android phones. Comes with Android 5.0, has 2 SIMs and SD memory card slot (all independent) and a good range of colours (NOTE: the colours are more saturated than appear in the pictures, at least the pink was, so what seemed to be a subtle salmon pink in the picture turned out to be a much brighter pink, but fortunately not quite ""teenage-girl shocking pink"").Very good bright screen, very good battery life, enough CPU power to be responsive, and lighter than I was expecting (lighter than the very similar BLU Studio X for example, but not quite as light or slim as the BLU Life One). The enclosed Silicone case (standard with BLU phones) is a great plus and obviates the need for a separate case (a screen protector is also included).I haven't compared the camera output on a large screen to the other BLU phones that I've mentioned, so I can't comment on the claims that the camera is better than what you typically find in this price range, but other reviewers seem to feel that is true, and I have no reason to doubt it (they called it Super Camera for a reason, I suppose)."
Negative,"Got the phone and like I had read in a lot of the reviews the battery didn't have a charge in it so charged it up, this phone uses the middle sized SIM card. Used the SIM card out of the Samsung 6S put it in a adaptor so it would fit, turned on the phone ran the update and then did the phone setup, works fantastic. Phone is the same size as the 6S, wife loves it."
Negative,Good!
Negative,"bought this as an upgrade from my BLU Win HD Windows I've had for over 2years now. Same size screen, of 5.0"" and this phone is an android and I'm loving it!! I love the BLU phones period and they are a great lasting phone!!"
Negative,"Functional phone, vibrant colors. Good value for the cost. We have 3 of these within the family so far and will be adding two more within the next few months. All in all I am pleased."
Negative,I have problems with my phone faulty wine at Christmas give it away now amazon does not give me the option of returning lost money feel .
Negative,I love it My Cricket siM card works
Negative,"I got this for a recent trip to Italy. I was looking for a simple unlocked phone that I could get a SIM chip for, then I saw this. I read the reviews about the camera and decided it would be a great phone and my vehicle for taking selfies as I traveled. I used the camera for that and for many of my shots, some videos and to geo-locate my pix. I also used it as a GPS and way finder with some apps including City Maps To Go that guided my around the maze of streets that is Rome. Plus It was a handy pocket way to get TripAdvisor recommendations.In short I used it more as a camera and travel guide than as a phone. It works great as a phone too. Plus, it comes with a nice gel case, screen protector and a great set of ear buds that I used on the plane when theirs were awful. They are very noise dampening so great for the plane. I'm going to see if I can get another pair."
Negative,"I ordered this phone from Amazon August 30,2015 received sometime in September 2015, on December 3, 2015 I started having problem with charging the phone...the charger would not charge that 1. The other problem is if the charge left on the phone is about 60% overnight next morning the phone is DEAD. Obviously, there is a problem that should be addressed. i am very dissappointed as feedback I got was that this phone works well...this is not my experience it's only three (3 ) months!!!!"
Negative,Cel phone does not work. And I cannot get a new one until Amazon receives the other one.
Negative,"Lite weight, an easy to carry. Function as easy as any android phone. Bright, and easy to read, in the day light as well as the evening. The camera self adjust to the room light for easy picture taking. Semi less attach to the T-Mobile account."
Negative,I love my phone ! Selfies are amazing ! . The camera is so perfect !! ..
Negative,Blu phone is functioning well now as it loses network often times. It has a very wonderful picture quality. I Hope it is very durable
Negative,"This phone is a marvel nothing to envy to other phones, is fast, the image quality of the photos is fabulous, as well as its performance. I highly recommend it when looking for a complete phone and at low cost. Although the shipment presented a slight delay the seller was in contact and successfully completed with the delivery time. Great phone."
Negative,Works great not to big or to small just right
Negative,Bought this for my son's wife. She absolutely loves it! Camera has many features and has a good battery life. I will purchase again!
Negative,"Very disappointed in the battery life of this phone. In addition to not being able to maintain a complete charge, the phone's charging port doesn't work most of the time. This is the second BLU phone I've purchased that has had this problem. I would not recommend this phone to anyone."
Negative,This is an awesome phone. Love the size. Love the clear screen. Works just great!
Negative,Is a good cell. I love it.
Negative,"I AM EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED IN THE QUALITY OF THIS PRODUCT!!! Yes the price is great, and the camera quality is decent, but be sure that you will have to be purchasing multiple phones. I am very careful to assure that my phone, all my things really, are in a safe place. On April 1st, 2016 I had this same phone in blue and I placed it on the table, remaining in the room. Not too long after I look at my phone and the screen is shattered, I LITERALLY HAVE NO CLUE HOW!!! Since the phone is cheap, I decided to buy the same phone again. Now just over a month later, so conveniently just after the Amazon 30 day return period, I tripped lightly with my phone in my hand. I did not fall. I did not drop my phone at all. I go to check the time on my phone right after, and what do we have here? MY SCREEN IS COMPLETELY MESSED UP!!!! HOW???? This time there is internal damage and because the phone is not a real name brand, I could not get the screen replaced anywhere. I will never buy this product again. I love Amazon products, but this is a serious let down and leads me to question the quality of there products. Also, I ABSOLUTELY want Amazon to refund my money. Literally the 30 days ended on May 4th and it broke the 11th. So upset :("
Negative,"Very happy with this phone. The screen was bigger than expected which is a plus to me. I easily converted it to straight talk all I had to do was switch my micro sim card to the Sim 2 slot (it has 2 sim card slots :) the camera and video on this was just what I wanted pictures are very clear the internet is fast as well not one complaint, I got the pink one it's a bright pastel shade of pink and it came with screen protectors and a pink jelly case a charger and headphones :)"
Negative,"For the Price, BLU Studio C Super Camera Unlocked Smartphone is well worth it!"
Negative,"For a budget phone, it really works well."
Negative,"Great phone, excellent photos, unlocked 4g, excellent speaker."
Negative,Great phone! second time I've purchased this model.
Negative,A very damn good phone for it's price plus I get to use it while overseas.
Negative,"Best phone I have ever had! Great cameras, screen, and overall performance! I had no problems using Skype and Youtube at the same time. This phone is a keeper :)"
Negative,Really like this phone. Takes really good pictures and has good phone reception.
Negative,"It's a great Blu device, its 4Ghz processor goes very fast in all the apps such as facebook, twitter, Google chrome, and others. My old phone is third part of this one. It has 400% more storage for apps that my old huawei y300 and it's an excellent Android phone. 3G signal works great in Venezuela with movistar and digitel."
Negative,Great phone. .. awesome camera
Negative,Excelent
Negative,"This phone for what ever reason freezes up, I do not have much app installed, it comes with some basic apps, the memory is practically used up by the android system such that there is not much left for you. I bought it in September 2015 and after getting frustrated by its performance I tried to return it today November 8, Amazon told me the return window has closed. The most annoying feature of this phone was when you try to retrieve your contacts, it takes forever to display which ever contact your searched for. I have some app that takes forever to load. In case you need to dial 911 on this phone or use speed dial, you will be dead by the time the phone opens the contact for you. I do not advice anybody to buy this phone. You have been warned!!!!!!!!!!!"
Negative,"No way to open back of phone, to insert phone chip. Instructions show back half of phone opens? its all solid on the back."
Negative,Take great pictures. Love it!
Negative,Great phone
Negative,"So far, I am extremely happy with this phone. MICRO SIM card is a little tricky to install. You have to flip up the silver metal SIM card slot to place sim card in and snap back down. Then lock into place. I could NOT! find any kind of instructions what so ever on this... Not even on YOUTUBE. Phone is nice size, thin, very responsive, great color and economically priced. I got the pink that came with pink cover."
Negative,Excellent device ¬°¬°
Negative,Thank you
Negative,Bought as a gift.
Negative,Daughter likes phone
Negative,"This phone is great, and the price is even better. I debated this purchase for a while, and finally went through with it. No regrets with that decision."
Negative,Phone is perfect for my needs. Works great with StraightTalk
Negative,"I'm in love with ma blu phone, I'm in love with ma blu phone, I got it for the low low, I'm in love with ma blu phone"
Negative,Very good!!!
Negative,"Bought this phone because it seemed like a good one for the price after reading the reviews. I will be returning this phone. There are so many things I dislike about this phone.A lot of the time, even when connected to Wi-Fi, my network would be dropped. I would have to turn airplane mode on and off and everything would be fine again. I don't blame my carrier because this has never happened with my previous phones.Also, the speed is very slow. I'm supposed to be getting 4g but the speed is sooo slow, like I'm getting 2g speeds. Nothing loads - nobody's Snapchat stories, my instagram feed, Facebook photos, nothing. The browsers and apps also crash easily if there is a lot going on.Another thing, notifications are VERY loud. Some people may like that I suppose, but not me. Even on the lowest setting it's still really loud! And it's actually not just notifications, videos play extremely loud too. I can't even enjoy a video by myself because playing one will totally overbear anybody talking or just any noise around period. So annoying. The only thing that isn't loud - and should be - is the speakerphone.I could probably list more and more things about this phone that I dislike. I was just extremely disappointed in this phone. I knew I wanted to return it the day after I received it.The camera is decent. The front camera is really good. That's the only good thing about this phone. This phone is called ""Blu Super Camera,"" and it seems like the camera is the only thing they were really concerned about when creating this phone."
Negative,"After 2 months I decided it was exactly what I was looking for... Well for a cheap price. My phone of three years was ready to rest for a while so I decided to look into this product because I'm a lover of photography, (but extremely poor) but this camera is incredible. Much better than the iPhone 6 and 6+! It has a long lasting battery. I listen to music up to 9 hours of my day on Google Play music and even after I get home around 6 it still has 20+ percentage left! Very happy with this phone."
Negative,"I really loved this phone, however after two weeks, my irresponsible self accidentally left it on top of my car when I went to work and it started pouring which got it water damaged. I know the warranty doesn't let you do anything with water damaged phones which made me very disappointed in myself. I was inexperienced with water damaged phones so I could't save it, I mean, it still works, but it won't read my sim card. However, I will still review it based on the time I had with it.I have Cricket/ AT&T and it worked perfectly fine. The camera quality was amazing. I was very happy that the camera was such high quality. As an avid photographer, I always tried to find a phone with great camera specs. The screen was clear and there was no lag even with many downloaded apps. The screen is also a decent size and the feel of the phone is very nice. As I don't have the kind of money to buy a galaxy or iPhone, this was a great alternative if you want something decent quality."
Negative,"phone received in the 14th of November and just happened exactly one month. where the phone did not fall, not mojo, treat it as a baby and wake up on Monday December 14 and the phone will not turn. I am completely disappointed because I had very good opinion of the phone. now I have to take a fix and being told you have."
Negative,My wife loves it
Negative,Perfect
Negative,Love this phone. I would recommend you try this phone if you want perfect picture quality and enough memory for a few apps and a few games. Had it for 2months Now and never froze
Negative,"Good image, bright color, run well, perfect for the price."
Negative,goo‚ÄÜd
Negative,Amazing phone for the price. The photos are great. The quality is amazing. Best phone for the price. Ignore the negative reviews and just get it. This one is the best since almost every other phone has negative camera review but in this one they supposedly(reading other reviews) gave it the same lens as the galaxy S5. I find that hard to believe but maybe somebody can let me know if that's true. The camera is not easy to learn so if by our getting blurry images change the settings like I did. I found that by using the 2 secod timer I got better photos
Negative,very nice
Negative,amazing camera
Negative,Love this smartphone. Takes great pictures and was well worth the money. I have bought several for family members.
Negative,good
Negative,"Got the phone and like I had read in a lot of the reviews the battery didn't have a charge in it so charged it up, this phone uses the middle sized SIM card. Used the SIM card out of the Samsung 6S put it in a adaptor so it would fit, turned on the phone ran the update and then did the phone setup, works fantastic. Phone is the same size as the 6S, wife loves it."
Negative,So far this is a nice phone for the money. The camera makes it though. Even if I didn't use it as a phone I'd still use it as a camera / WIFI web browser. It's not the best at web browsing but functional. I'm using my ATT GoPhone account with a new sim card. I still had an old flip phone when ATT made me get something more up to date so I can't compare. All in all though it's been pretty good. I like the FM radio and weather keeping track where I am. The bluetooth connected easy to my GPS for hands on driving. Great phone for this price.
Negative,this cell phone rules. you need this
Negative,good cellphone
Negative,Nice Android
Negative,"Camera is very good as these cameras go. Clear, little noise even in low light. Battery does run out a bit fast, but change the settings, turn down the screen, turn off the wifi when not in use, etc., and it's fine. Charges up fast, too. I bought an ""open box"" product that said it was used, but it seems not to have been used, just damaged packaging and a smudge on the back of the phone, saved 30%. I'm happy. I recommend the phone, especially for that price."
Negative,excellent product recommend
Negative,For the price i am totally satisfied. I dont buy expensive phones and this one for the price is and was a fantastic buy. It has worked flawlessly since day one and i would definitely would recommend it and or buy another.
Negative,Well worth the price tag. Pictures look great
Negative,excelente
Negative,Great price value relation
Negative,"DO NOT BUY THIS. I have had it since October of 2015, it is now July 2016 and the screen went completely black. I took it to a professional and it would cost a lot of money to fix. Waste of money."
Negative,Ecellent Product. Veri nice I like It.......
Negative,"Do not buy BLU phones. The screen died in 8 months. I flickered and turned white. I sent it to Blu for Warranty. They sent me a email saying it had ""liquor"" damage. I explained to them by phone that this phone was spare phone kept in a box on a shelf and there was not way it could be near any water. They refused to honor their Warranty. Very deceptive Miami company. I am returning another BLU phone I bought."
Negative,"works great, great pictures, priced super great"
Negative,Great phone for the price. I have purchased three in the past couple of years.
Negative,"Very disappointed in the battery life of this phone. In addition to not being able to maintain a complete charge, the phone's charging port doesn't work most of the time. This is the second BLU phone I've purchased that has had this problem. I would not recommend this phone to anyone."
Negative,Excelente
Negative,"Had this phone for almost a year now, and it is by far the best phone I ever had."
Negative,Great phone. .. awesome camera
Negative,Screen shattered within days of arriving from normal wear and tear WITH using a protective case. Money wasted.
Negative,The phones don't work that well on my network and they run really slow and the touch is off like I have to press the call bottom 4 or 5 times sometimes before it works I would like a refund off my money
Negative,Love it
Negative,"Lite weight, an easy to carry. Function as easy as any android phone. Bright, and easy to read, in the day light as well as the evening. The camera self adjust to the room light for easy picture taking. Semi less attach to the T-Mobile account."
Negative,"got this phone for my teenager, it worked without a hitch. Slipped in SIM, turned it on, added email, network details. Boom done runs smooth, exceptional camera. Lacks in storage but added 32gig sd card and off and running. All is good-one month of use-good battery life-solid case.For the price, an excellent deal."

Negative,I love my new phone. It surpasses my expectations. The studio c camera phone indeed has an excellent camera. Clear beautiful photos even from a moving train!!! I have been recommending this phone to my friends.
Negative,"This phone is a marvel nothing to envy to other phones, is fast, the image quality of the photos is fabulous, as well as its performance. I highly recommend it when looking for a complete phone and at low cost. Although the shipment presented a slight delay the seller was in contact and successfully completed with the delivery time. Great phone."
Negative,Work great
Negative,Good
Negative,This phone literally fell out of my lap and the screen shutoff completely.Definitely not worth it apparently even with the low price.It's great that my warranty on this ended 10 days before the device broke so nothing I can do.
Negative,My daughter loves it and loves taking pictures with it
Negative,"Before this one I had the Blu studio 5c HD and HATED it. I had nothing but problems and returned it 4 times before getting one that would work (even if not well). This one has been great! I've had no problems with it at all. I got mint green and wasn't very fond of the color when it came. It's a pale, pastel, mint green. The rubbery outside gets dirty quickly too but the plastic case that comes with it doesn't stay on. That being said I really love this phone. It takes nice, clear, hd looking pictures and runs well. I haven't had any problems with it like I did the previous phone. It does run slowly sometimes but it doesn't lock up or glitch out like the other one did."
Negative,weak
Negative,Purchased for grandson. He loves it.
Negative,Just love my phone. It's the best for only $100
Negative,very good product recommend

Negative,"It seemed good at first....until I went to activate it. I'm not sure if the problem was on the part of the phone or the carrier. I couldn't send or receive picture messages, and after contacting customer service for both I still couldn't come to a solution. I thought, okay, I can live without MMS. After a month the phone just DIED. Wouldn't charge. Wouldn't turn on. DEAD. Contacted BLU customer service, and they replied once every week or two weeks. There was no consistency, and they wanted me to pay to return the phone to be worked on. I had another BLU phone for years, and it was amazing. I'm surprised at the poor quality of this phone. It makes me not want to try again with BLU."
Negative,"not able to turn off data download for 2nd sim card - went an Android guru, and he was not able to determine how to do it. Major detraction for those of us with Sim cards from 2 different internet providers."
Negative,Sent it back no SIM card. Could not get SIM card in.
Negative,This phone was purchased for my mom. She absolutely loves it. She always wanted a phone with a bigger screen and she finally got one. It works great with NET10 prepaid service.
Negative,excelente
Negative,Colors are bold and bright! Phone works wonderfully!
Negative,"I love this phone. I am female, so it's just the right size for my hand. The processor is very fast. The phone doesn't lag at all...its lightening fast. I do love some of the features of lollipop vs. kit kat. I think one of my favorites is that notifications appear above the lock screen on a bar and each one can be swiped away or clicked on individually. Great phone for the price."
Negative,The best good
Negative,Love it and good price
Negative,High value without the high price.
Negative,"I am copying my same post for the BLU Energy X since I own both models and am very happy with both...So, I decided to switch wireless carriers and needed to get some new, unlocked phones at a reasonable price.. found BLU on Amazon. I was skeptical because I never heard of BLU, but reviews were good so I first ordered a ""BLU Studio C Super Camera"" phone for my teenager as a test. Loved the phone! Shortly after, got the same model for my wife. Then it was my turn and I was about to order the same model (Studio C Super Camera).. until I saw this Energy X model. It was a tough decision between the two, but I went with the Energy X. The Energy X boasts a larger battery and Android 5.1. The cameras are not quite as good as the Super Camera, but that was not important to me. The rest of the specs were basically the same. The Energy X is slightly thicker, which makes it easier to hold than the thinner one. The silicone case that comes with it is great, the phone is comfortable and non-slip in the hand. No need for a 3rd party case. If you get the Studio C Super Camera model, you should get an armor-tech case - it will be much easier to hold and less likely to slip out of your hand. No need to go into speeds & feeds here, you can read the specs and other techie reviews. I'm just letting you know that these BLU phones are very solid and enjoyable to use from my perspective. I suppose there are better phones out there if you want to spend the cash. But, I have no doubt that these are the best phones you can get for about $100. And since I never had an expensive smart phone to compare with... I certainly don't feel that I am missing out on anything. I put a 32GB SD card in each phone (about $12) each. So, more than enough memory to store tons of apps, pics, and my 1000+ MP3 songs. I can stream my FIOS, Netflix, etc. I can check my email, play my games, quickly surf the web, and buy more stuff from Amazon. Bottom line, we have 3 BLU phones and love them all so far!"
Negative,"Activated the phone with AT&T and it works great. I receive high signal strength almost everywhere I go at work and home. Not a top of the line phone but for the price and everything it comes with, very well worth it."
Negative,Dropped it less then a foot and shattered screen complete garbage. Do not buy.
Negative,EXCELENT PHONE. PERFECT CONDITIONS
Negative,BLU phones less bloated than other brands. Phone exactly as described. Works well.
Negative,love this phone but need to return because my standard simcard doesnt work :(
Negative,The BLU Studio C Super Camera exceeded my expectations. It is a great value.
Negative,Take great pictures. Love it!
Negative,good product in good condition. it works fine
Negative,Excelente
Negative,Good!
Negative,"bought this as an upgrade from my BLU Win HD Windows I've had for over 2years now. Same size screen, of 5.0"" and this phone is an android and I'm loving it!! I love the BLU phones period and they are a great lasting phone!!"
Negative,Great phone. .. awesome camera
Negative,Ever since I got the phone I literally can't keep my hand of it good one for what you need it for plus more awesome camera awesome service with straighttalk 4g good memory great look I highly recommend this phone for the price and the user
Negative,I just activated it yesterday and so far it's very solid for the price. Works well with straight talk
Negative,"Do not buy BLU phones. The screen died in 8 months. I flickered and turned white. I sent it to Blu for Warranty. They sent me a email saying it had ""liquor"" damage.

Very deceptive Miami company. I am returning another BLU phone I bought."
Negative,"This phone definitely rivals the more expensive Samsung Galaxy. The camera is truly a wonder! It has amazing filters, and even without a filter the picture is captured clear and in high definition. The largan lense really does take wide photos, so more background/scenery/people fit in photos! It works excellent in low light, and the flash is excellent.The dual-sim card feature holds both a mini sim card and micro sim card. The screen shows excellent colors at high definition.The storage is amazing!! The phone has 8GB for storage, but after 3GB are used for the Android operating system, there is still a lot of room for apps, etc. The phone can hold a micro sd memory card for my storage space. I currently have 15 apps installed, and still have almost 2GB of storage left.This is definitely a modern and high tech smart phone. The processor is fast, the apps all run fast and download quickly. The email is easy to set up.The call volume is somewhat on the quieter side, even at max volume, but, this is isn't a problem if you just hold the phone higher up on your ear.The phone itself is thin and lightweight. It charges quickly, a full charge in less than 3 hours. The battery lasts about 2 days of constant use (I mean CONSTANT, like I could not put this amazing phone down) and about 4 days when it's on standby.Definitely recommend for a great unlocked smartphone that is comparable to the name brands Samsung!! I would buy it again a million times over!!"
Negative,Ecellent Product. Veri nice I like It.......
Negative,"Quick phone, great specs. Stirdy design, great silicone case OF MATCHING COLOR included. Good sound - I am very happy with this babe. Using 4 days."
Negative,The BLU Studio C Super Camera exceeded my expectations. It is a great value.
Negative,This makes 4 blu cell phones and another one is on the way for a total of 5 blu cell phones in the family so far !we love these blu cell phones and for the money is one hell of alot of cell phone... Have not had any trouble withany of them ! Just cannot say enough good about blu cell phones...
Negative,"Had this phone for almost a year now, and it is by far the best phone I ever had."
Negative,Excellent
Negative,I love everything about this phone. This has been the best BLU cellphone that I has purchase so far.
Negative,good cellphone
Negative,"I live outside of the US. So I finally got my phone 8 days ago. Super cute, slim, very practical. JOY!!!Now 30mns ago, it turned off. Now the phone will not turn back on! It did for 2 seconds, like a flash, then blacked out! Now I am pressing the right side button to turn it on, it simply remains frozen on the blu logo. Seriously now??? Like really???"
Negative,I love my new BLU super C camera phone. The screen is large enough to make everything easily viable. I have a much better browser that gives me an amazing amount of information. I would reconmend this phone to everyone.
Negative,An inexpensive way to own a smartphone. It's my first smartphone so I needed a simple version. It doesn't have a bunch of preloaded apps I will not use so that is nice. It's thin and light. My husband bought the Blu 5.0 HD and it's a little thicker and heavier. He likes that it has a 13 MP camera but I'm happy with my 8 MP camera. The instructions for using the phone are on an app preloaded on the phone. It took me a while to figure that out. It says Blu help but I was afraid to tap it cuz I didn't understand the useage of data vs. wifi. Now I know so I'm becoming more adjusted to the smartphone concept. My husband and I both went to the ATT store to get new SIM cards since our old ones didn't fit. No cost to do that!!! They even applied my screen protector for me free of charge. It came with everything I needed.
Negative,"I oringinally had my sites set on an Iphone6s, but the family wasn't having it and told me to look for something no more than $150, two of my friends have BLU phones and love them so i decided to get this one, so far I love it, the camera is amazing front and back the screen size is perfect for those who like the bigger screens. I really can't say to much about the phone considering I've only had it for an hour or two."
Negative,"Functional phone, vibrant colors. Good value for the cost. We have 3 of these within the family so far and will be adding two more within the next few months. All in all I am pleased."
Negative,BLU cellphones are the best kept secret in the cellphone business. This is my 3rd Blu and you just can't go wrong with the combination of all of the great features and low price of the phone. This BLU Studio C Super Camera phone has everything that the phones in the $400-$700 price range have. I have 4 friends who bought a BLU after they saw mine.
Negative,"I really like BLU phones and would recommend them to anyone interested in a great value. This is my second BLU phone. Setup is easy, battery life is good, the phones look nice and feel good in the hand, and cases and screen protectors are readily available. If you're considering a smartphone purchase don't hesitate to buy BLU!!"
Negative,"Unfortunatelly the touch screen was inoperative, and had to return it."
Negative,Perfect
Negative,Cel phone does not work. And I cannot get a new one until Amazon receives the other one.
Negative,This is great buy for the Price had expected IIT to support otg but have had problems with this other than that I am pleased.
Negative,"Phenominal phone! Long story short, my wife was using a Galaxy S2 for years, and it was time to upgrade. She uses her phone for basic needs, and this phone was the answer for her long awaited upgrade.One of the things I've been impressed with most is the battery. She gets 3 days of usage out of a single charge, and still has battery life to spare!The phone is very snappy, has a great screen, is slimmer than I expected it to be, and comes with all of the basic accessories (case, ear phones, screen protector). It truly is amazing that a $99 phone (at the time of purchase) can perform like this. The back plate comes off, which exposes the 2 SIM card spots, and the MicroSD card slot as well. I popped in a 64GB card so she has room to grow, and that will take care of the job for years to come.On a side note, we use Ting as our cellular service provider. We both aren't big texters, data users, or phone talkers. In all, we have 2 smart phones and 1 ""dumb phone"" on our Ting account, and our monthly bill after taxes is $47. Ting uses either Sprint or T-Mobile service, just depeneds on what phone you choose to use. Just to be clear, I have nothing to gain by promoting BLU or Ting, just want to give a shout out that not all Smartphone plans have to cost $$$.Thanks BLU, when it comes time for me to upgrade, I'll be looking in your direction first!"
Negative,"Before this one I had the Blu studio 5c HD and HATED it. I had nothing but problems and returned it 4 times before getting one that would work (even if not well). This one has been great! I've had no problems with it at all. I got mint green and wasn't very fond of the color when it came. It's a pale, pastel, mint green. The rubbery outside gets dirty quickly too but the plastic case that comes with it doesn't stay on. That being said I really love this phone. It takes nice, clear, hd looking pictures and runs well. I haven't had any problems with it like I did the previous phone. It does run slowly sometimes but it doesn't lock up or glitch out like the other one did."
Negative,Send this phone to Colombia to a friend and it's working Fantastic. .thanks
Negative,Bought as a gift.
Negative,Very good
Negative,Daughter likes phone
Negative,Corners have purple spots on it was suppose to be like new or new phone but wasn't. Very disappointed
Negative,weak
Negative,"I am loving this phone! I just upgraded from the Studio 5c HD and am very, very pleased with it. I read the reviews and was sceptical at first but decided to purchase the phone. I am very glad I did!!! Thank you Blu for another great product!!!"
Negative,Thanks
Negative,"A very good option in BLU's line of Android phones. Comes with Android 5.0, has 2 SIMs and SD memory card slot (all independent) and a good range of colours (NOTE: the colours are more saturated than appear in the pictures, at least the pink was, so what seemed to be a subtle salmon pink in the picture turned out to be a much brighter pink, but fortunately not quite ""teenage-girl shocking pink"").Very good bright screen, very good battery life, enough CPU power to be responsive, and lighter than I was expecting (lighter than the very similar BLU Studio X for example, but not quite as light or slim as the BLU Life One). The enclosed Silicone case (standard with BLU phones) is a great plus and obviates the need for a separate case (a screen protector is also included).I haven't compared the camera output on a large screen to the other BLU phones that I've mentioned, so I can't comment on the claims that the camera is better than what you typically find in this price range, but other reviewers seem to feel that is true, and I have no reason to doubt it (they called it Super Camera for a reason, I suppose)."
Negative,Good
Negative,"great phone, fantastic camera for the price (see photos)"
Negative,This phone is amazing!!! Super clear camera which is something I was looking for. Only thing is I didn't get my screen protector.
Negative,Great phone
Negative,I RECOMMEND IT
Negative,"My husband loves his phone. After several days of searching with a criteria of Not too big, Not too small, Not too expensive, Has a good camera, Has a good speaker, Not alot of apps, Must have memory capabilities, Needs to be Straight Talk, Needs good recent reviews.....I finally selected this phone. It met all of my criteria. Needing to be 100% sure, I sent the link to Straight Talk to make sure there wouldn't be any issues. Ordered a SIM card. Needless to say, this phone works great!!! The screen is crystal clear. It's so much better than was expected. Received the phone a day earlier than the earliest day it was to arrive. Big plus when you really want a new phone. We all want it NOW. I can't say enough good things about this phone. The only negative thing I can think to say is that the power and volume controls are close to each other, but it's not a big concern, because if you've used phones for years, you've gotten used to it at one time. I also researched the company BLU....They make some good stuff."
Negative,For $100 this phone is a bargain. For the price the camera is fantastic and better than phones costing three times as much. Latest Android is also a major plus. My son is also playing games and no major complaints with lag etc...
Negative,OMG this phone is amazing . The camera is so much better then I had imagined . I do have some amazing pictures that I took of my son with the camera the first day I got it . I will have to update that when I get on the cell phone ( since they are on there )This does work great with straighttalk . I did have to set up the APN so if you do need help with that I would gladly help you just let me know . I am able to access internet and send and receive picture message with no problem .The color of the screen is amazing too . This is well worth the money that I did spend . I am so glad I did not spend hundreds of dollars on a samsung or LG etc . This to me seems better . So if you have any questions before you order the phone let me know and I will answer you as honest as I can .
Negative,"I might have gotten a ""second batch"" since mine has been smooth and glitch free compared with some complaints from earlier purchasers.I purchased this as a backup/travel phone and local tablet (yes, a 5"" micro tablet) and am very pleased with the screen quality for watching Netflix. It's very bright and vibrant. As a video watcher and Kindle reader, the slim thickness, lightweight help a lot. Battery life is superb - I don't have to turn it off to preserve the battery from day to day, I just turned off wifi refresh when ""sleeping.""Check other reviewers for phone call quality. I just wanted to get the word out that the screen is superb, not a bargain basement screen at all, very sharp with 720p in a 5"" display."
Negative,At first I thought this was not bad for the price. The fact is the product just stopped working after only owning it 11 days. Phone shutoff at night and would not reboot. No response what so ever. It would not show if connected to a charger or plugged in to computer. I have read people having the same issues. I think the quality of parts is very very poor. Guess you get what you pay for. Amazon had no problem excepting my request to return. Hopefully the return process is as smooth as expected.
Negative,"Lite weight, an easy to carry. Function as easy as any android phone. Bright, and easy to read, in the day light as well as the evening. The camera self adjust to the room light for easy picture taking. Semi less attach to the T-Mobile account."
Negative,I love my phone ! Selfies are amazing ! . The camera is so perfect !! ..
Negative,My wife loves it so far! Nice display
Negative,"I actually quite loved the phone. Used it for like a week....turned it off each night, made sure it was charged right. However i turned it off tonight and went to plug it in...won't charge and now won't turn on....seriously? Its like a week old and already dead??!!?!?!? Waste of money and now i'm out a cell phone and however much money i paid for this. Prolly won't ever buy another BLU phone again. Seriously disappointed."
Negative,I love my new BLU super C camera phone. The screen is large enough to make everything easily viable. I have a much better browser that gives me an amazing amount of information. I would reconmend this phone to everyone.
Negative,"I really loved this phone, however after two weeks, my irresponsible self accidentally left it on top of my car when I went to work and it started pouring which got it water damaged. I know the warranty doesn't let you do anything with water damaged phones which made me very disappointed in myself. I was inexperienced with water damaged phones so I could't save it, I mean, it still works, but it won't read my sim card. However, I will still review it based on the time I had with it.I have Cricket/ AT&T and it worked perfectly fine. The camera quality was amazing. I was very happy that the camera was such high quality. As an avid photographer, I always tried to find a phone with great camera specs. The screen was clear and there was no lag even with many downloaded apps. The screen is also a decent size and the feel of the phone is very nice. As I don't have the kind of money to buy a galaxy or iPhone, this was a great alternative if you want something decent quality."
Negative,"I've had this phone for several months now and I can say without a doubt this is better than any Samsung, LG or iPhone I have ever owned and I have owned them all. Faster and more stable. I will be buying only Blu phones in the future."
Negative,"I purchased the first phone about 2 months ago and started to have problems immediately.There was no cell reception. I thought the phone was defective until I traveled into the city.We live in an area where the cell signal is not that strong. Both of our previous T-Mobile Dash's will receivethe cell signal with 1 bar, good enough to do anything. These phones will also lose the signal whiletraveling on main roads where our previous phones will stay connected. I though that this might be a bad build so I wentand ordered another for my wife. The same thing. Poor reception. I know that each phone was from a differentlot so I can assume that the phones have a lower sensitivity by design.So now we have 2 phones that while at home are useless. And this is the main purpose of the purchase, telephone.I will say that the camera works as it should. The wifi works altho I did not check the sensitivity (range) ofphone using this mode. The operating system (andriod) works fine.I also took multiple 32 gig micro sd cards and checked to see if they work. Yes, I was able to view a PDF, picturestaken from another camera, and videos in mp4 format. Not only ones that I downloaded from YouTube but large ones:full DVDS that I used Handbrake to convert to MP4. File size anywhere from 700MB to 1.2GB.Since I can't get any calls at home and our plan is pay as you go, I can't purchase any time unless I'maway from home. This is a major problem for us. This also precludes getting email or texts pushed up to the phone.So all in all, I consider this phone to be useless."
Negative,Excellent phone great camera and for the price its a steal
Negative,"Great phone, quality build light weight and very responsive. I would recommend to a friend."
Negative,everything is perfect so far... 10 days with the cellphone. highly recommend...
Negative,Love this phone.Relatively easy to set up.Good sound.Takes some of the best pictures I've ever taken.Definitely recommend this to friends.
Negative,Good
Negative,"I purchased this phone for my wife as a replacement for her other smartphone which was locking up on her. The design and build quality of the super camera model is far better than star design edition she previously used. It is quick and enjoyable to use. I set it up for her and it was a breeze to set up. It is a good size,light and came with a screen protector and a silicone case that wraps around the back and fits nicely.So far a great phone for the price and she said she loves it!"
Negative,"Got the phone and like I had read in a lot of the reviews the battery didn't have a charge in it so charged it up, this phone uses the middle sized SIM card. Used the SIM card out of the Samsung 6S put it in a adaptor so it would fit, turned on the phone ran the update and then did the phone setup, works fantastic. Phone is the same size as the 6S, wife loves it."
Negative,I love everything about this phone. This has been the best BLU cellphone that I has purchase so far.
Negative,"This phone is a marvel nothing to envy to other phones, is fast, the image quality of the photos is fabulous, as well as its performance. I highly recommend it when looking for a complete phone and at low cost. Although the shipment presented a slight delay the seller was in contact and successfully completed with the delivery time. Great phone."
Negative,"Camera is very good as these cameras go. Clear, little noise even in low light. Battery does run out a bit fast, but change the settings, turn down the screen, turn off the wifi when not in use, etc., and it's fine. Charges up fast, too. I bought an ""open box"" product that said it was used, but it seems not to have been used, just damaged packaging and a smudge on the back of the phone, saved 30%. I'm happy. I recommend the phone, especially for that price."
Negative,very good product recommend
Negative,Good job so far ;;''/
Negative,I RECOMMEND IT
Negative,My son absolutely loves his
Negative,Send this phone to Colombia to a friend and it's working Fantastic. .thanks
Negative,"love the phone, works great!! never had a problem...use straight talk and couldn't be happier!! the pictures are out of this world!!"
Negative,Love this phone. I would recommend you try this phone if you want perfect picture quality and enough memory for a few apps and a few games. Had it for 2months Now and never froze
Negative,Perfect. Works just as good as my wife's Samsung Galaxy4.
Negative,good cellphone
Negative,Got as a replacement for a Galaxy SII- absolutely worth it.
Negative,Well worth the price tag. Pictures look great
Negative,Great phone. .. awesome camera

Negative,"I received the phone today. Its actually for my girlfriend and right away she loved it. From what I see the phone is awesome, maybe even better than my Galaxy Mega 2! So far so good!Great buy, prompt delivery. I LOVE Amazon!!"
Negative,Phone blacked out after a week and had to return it.
Negative,very nice
Negative,"I just love this phone, Im in El Salvador, it works more than fine, smolthly Lollipop, fast, runs perfect Boom Beach, no bugs or lags, the only bad thing its that i didnt bought two or three !"
Negative,"Lite weight, an easy to carry. Function as easy as any android phone. Bright, and easy to read, in the day light as well as the evening. The camera self adjust to the room light for easy picture taking. Semi less attach to the T-Mobile account."
Negative,For the price i am totally satisfied. I dont buy expensive phones and this one for the price is and was a fantastic buy. It has worked flawlessly since day one and i would definitely would recommend it and or buy another.
Negative,Love it
Negative,EXCELENTE PRODUCTO
Negative,not linking the phone.
Negative,"my mother only use 2 month,now the phone only run about 10 minutes every time"
Negative,I love my new phone. It surpasses my expectations. The studio c camera phone indeed has an excellent camera. Clear beautiful photos even from a moving train!!! I have been recommending this phone to my friends.
Negative,This phone was purchased for my mom. She absolutely loves it. She always wanted a phone with a bigger screen and she finally got one. It works great with NET10 prepaid service.
Negative,"I ordered this phone from Amazon August 30,2015 received sometime in September 2015, on December 3, 2015 I started having problem with charging the phone...the charger would not charge that 1. The other problem is if the charge left on the phone is about 60% overnight next morning the phone is DEAD. Obviously, there is a problem that should be addressed. i am very dissappointed as feedback I got was that this phone works well...this is not my experience it's only three (3 ) months!!!!"
Negative,bought this as a bday gift for my lil sis after her phone broke and she hasn't been off it not even for a second. She loves it and it works perfectly
Negative,excelente
Negative,great!
Negative,Love this phone. I would recommend you try this phone if you want perfect picture quality and enough memory for a few apps and a few games. Had it for 2months Now and never froze
Negative,"got this phone for my teenager, it worked without a hitch. Slipped in SIM, turned it on, added email, network details. Boom done runs smooth, exceptional camera. Lacks in storage but added 32gig sd card and off and running. All is good-one month of use-good battery life-solid case.For the price, an excellent deal."
Negative,Perfect. Works just as good as my wife's Samsung Galaxy4.
Negative,I bought it for Christmas and so far I have no complaints I love it
Negative,Such a great buy. I was skeptical b/c I have never heard of BLU before. My doubt quickly disappeared when I decided to bite the bullet and buy the phone. Immediately I was shocked that I received such a great phone for such a price. I was impressed w/ the quality of front facing camera and have actually received praise over when video chatting or sending selfies. A great buy for those who utilize the front camera often.
Negative,This phone is the bomb dot com yes its that great . Was a bit of pain to activate in straight talk as it requires a sim card but other than that so worth the money and the camera!!!! OMG the camera.
Negative,Great Product for the price!
Negative,I love this phone. I really do no complaints at all.
Negative,"Great phone, nice screen, comes with a few items that would typically be extra with any other smart phone. The camera is really good and the face touch up that's built in as the editing tool is the best part of the whole phone. Probably the best phone for the money at this time. Comparable to iphone 6 or the lg's, samsungs that are out there."
Negative,"suddenly, PHONE died after 5 months. it is not starting or accepting charging.. no way to fix this issue until date and workaround available from blu or on the internet . This phone has built in battery therefore you will not be able to remove battery to reset cell...other freiend has same cell has another problem, the cell stuck in vibration mode while charging and no option to solve this one too.. I would not recommend this phone due to these problems."
Negative,"This phone is great, all my apps work well and the battery life is suuficient for someone who listens to music on their way to work and uses social media throughout the day. I only have to charge my phone once a day depending on how often I use it. I don't play games so I can't say much about the battery life in reagrds to that. But for regular daily usage it is just great and the cameras take good pictures. Howeverr the phone restarts itself from time to time I'm not sure this happens though, but apart from that everything works well."
Negative,"I AM EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED IN THE QUALITY OF THIS PRODUCT!!! Yes the price is great, and the camera quality is decent, but be sure that you will have to be purchasing multiple phones. I am very careful to assure that my phone, all my things really, are in a safe place. On April 1st, 2016 I had this same phone in blue and I placed it on the table, remaining in the room. Not too long after I look at my phone and the screen is shattered, I LITERALLY HAVE NO CLUE HOW!!! Since the phone is cheap, I decided to buy the same phone again. Now just over a month later, so conveniently just after the Amazon 30 day return period, I tripped lightly with my phone in my hand. I did not fall. I did not drop my phone at all. I go to check the time on my phone right after, and what do we have here? MY SCREEN IS COMPLETELY MESSED UP!!!! HOW???? This time there is internal damage and because the phone is not a real name brand, I could not get the screen replaced anywhere. I will never buy this product again. I love Amazon products, but this is a serious let down and leads me to question the quality of there products. Also, I ABSOLUTELY want Amazon to refund my money. Literally the 30 days ended on May 4th and it broke the 11th. So upset :("
Negative,My son absolutely loves his
Negative,"Best phone I've ever had. Fast shipping, got here immediately the next day its so blue and pretty! It's a blue blu phone xD great camera azing actually the clarity to it. So happy with my choice thank you."
Negative,What I thought was going to be a cheap Chinese non functional spare phone turned out to be a nice easy to use good phone.
Negative,"This phone is great, and the price is even better. I debated this purchase for a while, and finally went through with it. No regrets with that decision."
Negative,"Well, for what its worth...I'm not a big picture taker or internet surfer. I bought this phone because I wanted a larger...but not LARGE...screen. And I have to say that so far, I love it. Not only is the screen the perfect size, the colors are clear and vibrant. Its VERY easy to operate and I found that I also like the color a lot (I got the green). Phone arrived with charger, adapter, head set, and a silicone sleeve. I have purchased another BLU phone for my daughter for Christmas. Hopefully she will love it as much as I love mine."
Negative,"Great phone , my mom loves it :P , its better than her old iphone 4 and has better features than ios 6 ."
Negative,Excellent
Negative,Great phone. .. awesome camera
Negative,Bought as a gift.
Negative,"I received the phone today. Its actually for my girlfriend and right away she loved it. From what I see the phone is awesome, maybe even better than my Galaxy Mega 2! So far so good!Great buy, prompt delivery. I LOVE Amazon!!"
Negative,"5 star for the price. Very good smart phone with Google app, unlocked phone without expensive two year contract. I had purchased a sim card from ultra mobile , easy set up.plan start $19 and up no contract."
Negative,Great phone
Negative,"So far, I am extremely happy with this phone. MICRO SIM card is a little tricky to install. You have to flip up the silver metal SIM card slot to place sim card in and snap back down. Then lock into place. I could NOT! find any kind of instructions what so ever on this... Not even on YOUTUBE. Phone is nice size, thin, very responsive, great color and economically priced. I got the pink that came with pink cover."
Negative,This phone literally fell out of my lap and the screen shutoff completely.Definitely not worth it apparently even with the low price.It's great that my warranty on this ended 10 days before the device broke so nothing I can do.
Negative,she loves it
Negative,"This product is of high quality, 100% recommended."
Negative,I read some reviews before buying the phone and I could have been discouraged from buying it. The main reason I bought was because I was broke and the phone i was using suddenly began to mess up. Someone said the battery was not very good and I serious usage I will say its a lie (suggestion turn off the battery percentage as it does not tell the truth sometimes). For $99 this phone is worth every penny. It's not as fast as needed but hey I didn't have to break the bank. One more thing when buying buy atleast a 16gb memory card with it ( you will need it)
Negative,I am loving my new phone. It is a beauty. The camera is clean and crisp. A superb phone for under $100
Negative,"Have been using this phone for two weeks now. I absolutely love it. Sound quality is great, battery life is good. The pics look great! So happy I bought this phone. I did a lot of research before purchasing. Great price for phone! Would highly recommend! üòÅ To all those wondering, this phone will work with straight talk, T-Mobile, cricket, or any GSM network. It is not compatible with CDMA networks like Verizon and sprint. I'm using it with straight talk. I just put my sim card in and it was ready to go."
Negative,Really like this phone. Takes really good pictures and has good phone reception.
Negative,Love this phone.Relatively easy to set up.Good sound.Takes some of the best pictures I've ever taken.Definitely recommend this to friends.
Negative,Corners have purple spots on it was suppose to be like new or new phone but wasn't. Very disappointed
Negative,weak
Negative,Great Phone!!
Negative,Phone exceeded my expectations. Pictures excellent. Sound quality good as well. Very good performance for the category and price.Five stars
Negative,"not able to turn off data download for 2nd sim card - went an Android guru, and he was not able to determine how to do it. Major detraction for those of us with Sim cards from 2 different internet providers."
Negative,"So far so good had it for a month now , with everything about this phone camera is great I'm using it come Oct 23rd 2015 for my wedding and to record a video for my mother who couldn't make it... Sound quality great for music and video s I like Pandora plays very well and loudly enough to where if I leave the room my phone is in I can still hear what is playing through out the house memory space works wonders for me I'm able to download all my social media apps plus games currently running five social media and four games plus my shopping apps such as retail me not and HEB all on the internal memory I bought a 32GB memory card just encase, the screen is nice size for watching videos on YouTube or what not... it's a major plus considering the old phone I used to have all in all no complaints."
Negative,A very damn good phone for it's price plus I get to use it while overseas.
Negative,"Got the phone and like I had read in a lot of the reviews the battery didn't have a charge in it so charged it up, this phone uses the middle sized SIM card.

Negative,"bought this as an upgrade from my BLU Win HD Windows I've had for over 2years now. Same size screen, of 5.0"" and this phone is an android and I'm loving it!! I love the BLU phones period and they are a great lasting phone!!"
Negative,"I was willing to overlook the lack of memory (no room to install even a few basic apps), non-working camera, and occasional freezing, but then just 5 months after purchasing the phone, it died without warning. I really wish I had just ordered another phone from the start. This is the first BLU product I've ever purchased and it will be my last."
Negative,BLU cellphones are the best kept secret in the cellphone business. This is my 3rd Blu and you just can't go wrong with the combination of all of the great features and low price of the phone. This BLU Studio C Super Camera phone has everything that the phones in the $400-$700 price range have. I have 4 friends who bought a BLU after they saw mine.
Negative,"Unfortunatelly the touch screen was inoperative, and had to return it."
Negative,Excellent device ¬°¬°
Negative,Works great with T-Mobile. Very easy to setup. Had to get the smaller sims card as the regular size does not work with this phone. Takes nice clear photos. Great phone especially for the price. Exceeded my expectations.
Negative,Great price value relation
Negative,Good cost quality.
Negative,"Over the weekend I shows this to a bunch of relatives. Even set it next to a relative's Samsung S6 and it looks just as nice. Battery life is incredible.In a world where the latest iPhone is $1000 and the latest flagship Samsung device is 1/2 to 3/4 of that price you really have to wonder how bad a $110 phone is. Supridingly, this is an excellent phone. It may not be the best at any one thing but really aren't any glaring deficiencies. The screen is big, high resolution IPS and bright. The phone is responsive and the relatively stock Android Operating system is easy to use and customize. The battery life is excellent. Blu tosses in a cover and screen protector for free. This phone is kind of a no-brainer for those who don't want to invest a lot of cash or if they have kids who abuse phones. You can even run dual SIMs and expand the storage memory. It has a nice solid fell and looks and fells like a much more expensive phone. I like it a lot![+] Notable Feature: Dual SIM slots[+] Display: 5"" IPS HD, 720x1280,Gorilla Glass 3 (scratch resistant)[+] OS: Android 5 Lollipop[+] Network: ATT/Tmobile HSPA+[+] CPU: 1.3 Ghz Quad Core[+] Camera: 8MP Sony Front, 5MP Back[+] Mem ory: 1GB RAM[+] Storage: 8GB Storage and up to an additional 64GB with Micro SD Slot[+] Battery: 2800 mAh Battery for 72 hours usage[+] Connectivity: USB 2.0, Bluetooth 4.0, Wi-Fi B/GN[+] Comes with: Headset, protective case, screen protector, charging cable, wall plug and instructions."
Negative,battery doesn't last long.
Negative,I have had the phone for several weeks now without a hint of problem. Great buy!
Negative,Garbage just throw it away waste your money
Negative,Great phone! second time I've purchased this model.
Negative,"This phone is a marvel nothing to envy to other phones, is fast, the image quality of the photos is fabulous, as well as its performance. I highly recommend it when looking for a complete phone and at low cost. Although the shipment presented a slight delay the seller was in contact and successfully completed with the delivery time. Great phone."
Negative,"Camera is very good as these cameras go. Clear, little noise even in low light. Battery does run out a bit fast, but change the settings, turn down the screen, turn off the wifi when not in use, etc., and it's fine. Charges up fast, too. I bought an ""open box"" product that said it was used, but it seems not to have been used, just damaged packaging and a smudge on the back of the phone, saved 30%. I'm happy. I recommend the phone, especially for that price."
Negative,Kids love phone and vibrant colors... Great phone
Negative,"I got this for a recent trip to Italy. I was looking for a simple unlocked phone that I could get a SIM chip for, then I saw this. I read the reviews about the camera and decided it would be a great phone and my vehicle for taking selfies as I traveled. I used the camera for that and for many of my shots, some videos and to geo-locate my pix. I also used it as a GPS and way finder with some apps including City Maps To Go that guided my around the maze of streets that is Rome. Plus It was a handy pocket way to get TripAdvisor recommendations.In short I used it more as a camera and travel guide than as a phone. It works great as a phone too. Plus, it comes with a nice gel case, screen protector and a great set of ear buds that I used on the plane when theirs were awful. They are very noise dampening so great for the plane. I'm going to see if I can get another pair."
Negative,"my mother only use 2 month,now the phone only run about 10 minutes every time"
Negative,"For the Price, BLU Studio C Super Camera Unlocked Smartphone is well worth it!"
Negative,good cellphone
Negative,"The 5 start rating I am giving this is considering that it is cheap. For 99 bucks this is an amazing phone, but you will be disappointed if you compare it to a $500+ device like an Iphone 6 or Galaxy S6.I am floored at the capability and quality at this price point. Honestly at this low of a price I expected that it would be a piece of junk that I would be sending it back. The mass of positive reviews convinced my to give it a try. After 2 months I am hooked on BLU. I'm never getting a phone on contract or overpaying for a phone again.Pro- Value for money- Camera quality- Android 5.0- minimal bloatware- included silicon case and screen cover- Screen qualityCon- A little slow."
Negative,"I live outside of the US. So I finally got my phone 8 days ago. Super cute, slim, very practical. JOY!!!Now 30mns ago, it turned off. Now the phone will not turn back on! It did for 2 seconds, like a flash, then blacked out! Now I am pressing the right side button to turn it on, it simply remains frozen on the blu logo. Seriously now??? Like really???"
Negative,Yes my daughter loves it!!
Negative,I bought it for Christmas and so far I have no complaints I love it
Negative,Excellent
Negative,Great phone for the price. I have purchased three in the past couple of years.
Negative,I love this phone. I really do no complaints at all.
Negative,Excelent
Negative,"Finally! A phone that can keep up with my lifestyle! I have burned through MANY phones in my day. Usually, within a week of purchase I can find at least one thing I don't like about a phone. Memory too low, it locks up when I have Pandora & Facebook running, not so great camera, etc. This phone I've owned for over 2 months and it is flawless! So easy to use, GREAT camera, quick app processing. All in all it is the best phone I've ever owned!"
Negative,excellent product
Negative,This phone was purchased for my mom. She absolutely loves it. She always wanted a phone with a bigger screen and she finally got one. It works great with NET10 prepaid service.
Negative,"I ordered this phone from Amazon August 30,2015 received sometime in September 2015, on December 3, 2015 I started having problem with charging the phone...the charger would not charge that 1. The other problem is if the charge left on the phone is about 60% overnight next morning the phone is DEAD. Obviously, there is a problem that should be addressed. i am very dissappointed as feedback I got was that this phone works well...this is not my experience it's only three (3 ) months!!!!"
Negative,bought this as a bday gift for my lil sis after her phone broke and she hasn't been off it not even for a second. She loves it and it works perfectly
Negative,Well worth the price tag. Pictures look great
Negative,High value without the high price.
Negative,I just activated it yesterday and so far it's very solid for the price. Works well with straight talk
Negative,No
Negative,It is not what I thought
Negative,Good
Negative,As Described!
Negative,"Only after 6 months, the speaker stopped working. The pictures taken were blurry.Would not recommend this phone"
Negative,Excelent phone
Negative,"A really goodphone, it uses the small sim chip but works perfectly. The only thing is unless you buy the cover at amazon it really hard to buy on a retail store that sells blu products."
Negative,I bought this for a trip out of the country so that i could buy a local plan when I was on vacation in Africa. This phone did not work in any capacity. The sim cards were not recognized. That was disappointing but I thought I could at least use it when I had wifi available in the hotels. Wrong again. I could not get it to stop setting itself back to May 1970 and then it wouldn't work with my google or gmail account to receive emails because of the wrong date. it would also not keep the time. I kept setting the time so I could at least know what time it was and have an alarm clock. I turned off the auto time set and changed it to manual time and that would work until the phone would be turned off and then it would set itself to some bizarre time zone and date. Really worthless and of course I was out of the country with no phone or data plan available to me because of this worthless phone.
Negative,"Have to say that I was not expecting much from this phone, thinking it was a cheap quality, recyclable phone, but I must say that I am actually impressed. I have been using everything from Iphones to Samsungs, to LGs, all high end phones with high end names and this, I must say, competes with those at a fraction of the price. Heck if this broke, I would buy another, no need to purchase warranty or deal with the carrier, just simply replace it or get a newer one. Speed-wise I must say that this was very decent and stays on par with perhaps not the latest phone, but phones only months old. This is a no brainer for anyone who breaks their phone often or hates dealing with the retailers all the time like I do. A must have!"
Negative,"The system keeps freezing forcing me to reboot the phone. When I reboot, the date and time changes back to 1969 or 1970. So when I try to access any app I keep getting messages to reset my date and time in order to access the app. In addition, I set my contacts to organise by first name but it only stays at last name. This really sucks. I'm disappointed. Bought an older version for my son and it works perfectly. I was impressed that's why I decided to get one for myself. Did I mention I'm disappointed? Another thing, I'm unable to switch between calls."
Negative,"This phone works pretty well. It is unlocked and can work in Liberia, West Africa. It works with Simple and T-Mobile."
Negative,"Great merchandise, swift shipping"
Negative,bad cell bad sign 3g -4g in voice
Negative,Being an iphone user for ten years now I was very reluctant to buy this phone for everyday use but it kicks butt. Thie large screen is a world above my iphone 5. You can easily tweak the android system to run efficiently which Apple does not allow. Just go to -settings -about phone-click on about phone six or seven times...this will then open up a new option above where you see about phone...click and enjoy all the super advanced settings you now have total control over.

Negative,"This phone is terrible.... the carriers listed as compatible are apparently not since the phone constantly couldn't find the network or make calls or send any texts. I contacted Blu and got no help, so I am stuck returning it."
Negative,"If your looking for a phone that takes IMEI code with any sim card then this is it. It's has 4G but no 4G LTE, however, the 4G is fast enough as it is. The battery life is way much better than the Samsung Galaxy. I would recommend this phone for app users and talkers."
Negative,very good
Negative,"The cell arrived and in less than two days did not work, having the bad card and the cell phone is not good. Very bad buy"
Negative,"This is such a good phone for the price! It was super easy to set up. I got it for my daughter as a first phone and she absolutely went nuts! Only thing I have to say is that in low light the camera quality isn't great. But in lots of lights it is amazing. I compared it to my Samsung Galaxy s6 Edge Plus and it wasn't that far off! And by the way if you drop your phone a lot I would recommend getting a case separately because the case they include is just for looks, and if you ever dropped it could break. Overall great phone!"

Negative,"My rating is price dependent. I've been an iPhone user since the iPhone 3 came out. I updated to an iPhone 6 last year and have been pleased with the larger size . We just retired and another spendy phone for my wife's old eyes isn't in the budget. She got the 6 and I got the Blu. Only had it for 3 days and I am amazed at the quality for $89 . It has a beautiful screen and a very solid feeling. It has no LTE , so big data users wouldn't be happy . I've been seeing about 4 Mbps download speeds with Cricket which is plenty for me. If I get a year out of the phone at this price then all is good."
Negative,"I thought this phone would be great. From other people's ratings and the price, it seemed to be a good thing. Turns out, it isn't. I didn't like the way my group mms would pop up as a ""download"" and then it wouldn't download for me to open and read. The pictures aren't bad, until you tried to send one. It would come out distorted and looked like crap. Common places where I would get 4g/LTE service, this phone could only give me 3G or no service. It just wasn't my cup of tea. Needless to say, I sold it to friend for half price (even after telling him the bad things about it) but he chose to take it anyways. I hope he likes it better then I did! Grrr"

Negative,"*EDIT 5/8/2015: This phone has just received the Kitkat update at the end of April (I think, or sometime this week) for those who were/are looking forward to it. The version is 4.4.2 to be more specific and there is a slight glitch where it requires 800+ Mb to download and, even have over that much, it still requires more (still updates though and all I did was uninstall the updates for Google apps since you can always update them afterwards).I decided to take a risk and buy this phone. Being fairly new, I didn't know what to expect. The phone comes with Jellybean 4.3, but I was told that there should be a Kitkat update for the phone (never said when, but that it will be coming). The phone is pretty fast and you can help speed it up by going to settings>developer options>and turning off (or lowering to .5x) Window animation scale, Transition animation scale, and Animator duration scale (if you don't see the options go to About device and tap on build number until it grants you developer options.The camera is alright for a 5-megapixel camera and I like that it has flash. You can even download the Focal beta app if you want more options. The audio is great with the back speaker (haven't used the included earphones). Video quality is great as well, I streamed Netflix and watched a video on another site and both had great quality. There aren't too many installed apps and the phone has 2.2GB out of the 4GB for internal memory. I ordered a 32GB micro sd card just in case I need more storage.The battery life is pretty good, though I haven't used it too much. The screen protector isn't that great, I still have to use the cloth that came with my glasses to clean the screen because it picks up fingerprints too easily. The main reason I got this phone over others was because it was a pretty amazing price tag for an LTE phone that has a quad-core processor and 1GB of RAM. The size of the phone is perfect for me and I have huge hands (approximately 8 3/4 inches long and 4 inches wide). The included silicone case provides extra grip and matches the phone.If you're in need of an LTE device for a low price and are fine with the specs, buy this phone. I won't say you won't be disappointed since everyone has their own opinions, but I can say that I'm glad I bought this phone.*For users that want to root your phone: I was only successful by using iRoot, which appears to be a Chinese program. It installs its own Super User type app and I haven't been able to uninstall it yet, but I downloaded SuperSU and it took over just fine."
Negative,ProsFits in your pocket. Good reception. Works on t mobile hspa in NYC area. Unlocked and works with many cariers. Good 4g coverage. Display is good and sound from speakers are good too. Recently upgraded to KitKat 4.4.2. Headphone music is good.Cons:Usable space about 2.3gigs. Must buy the micro SD card .Apps on SD card flaky at best. Many apps on SD card are inconsistent and require reinstalls. Amazon music file arbitrarily disappears.Camera leaves a lot to be desired . poor pictures mostly blurry repeatedly. Video is grainy and requires great light and in sunny weather the camera is good.Weighed pros and cons I would get it if your phone is not your primary camera and you don't want to spend 300 and above for a phone.
Negative,Great Android Phone. Thanks!!
Negative,My mother loves her new phone. She says it's bright and fast. It connected without problems to the 4G band in Argentina.
Negative,"Much Better than my Samsung Galaxy S2, lol. But I love this phone for the price its Great. Only wish it had atleast a 12 MP camera, at the same cost of course."
Negative,"has alot of software problems. now three months later my phone will no longer hold a charge, and you changed the price i want a refund! replacement!"

Negative,"DO NOT BUY FROM BREED!I bought this phone from the supplier ""BREED"" and everything was wrong from day one. The phone was delivered in damaged packaging, the inside of the plastic bag that the phone was in had a weird smelly black dust like substance, there were scratches on the phone and it didn't charge properly.I bought this phone on August 11th 2016 and today October 22nd 2016 the phone screen turned all white and then cut off. Now the screen doesn't work.I NO NOT believe this is a problem with the phone brand or model I think i was sold an already defective phone by BREED.BREED's customer service is the absolute worst I have ever seen on amazon over the years.While the phone worked it was amazing I'm going to buy the exact same model just from a different supplier."

Negative,"Phone is perfect, works great on tmobile service. Love the flash on the front camera. Awesome, gift. Thanks."
Negative,Exelente
Negative,Very good product
Negative,"Great phone with great value, not a cheap phone.IPS screen is very nice color and wide viewing angle. Resolution is not as high as $800 phones but I don't see any difference.Speed is fast and no lags.On ATT network, I see 4g even though I don't have data. Older international BLU phones does not connect 4g so this new phone is great.To open the case, insert fingernail on gap at bottom right corner and gently wedge open right side about 1/32"" at time toward top.It uses micro sim. Orientation picture inside the case for sim is wrong. Place connectors on bottom and insert clipped corner first.Also when installing screen protector, align front camera hole 1/128"" below centering the camera hole.Soft case is also nice and screen protector are included so that's additional $10 valueMy older 5"" phone was about 1/2"" larger in both directions.Speakers are LOUD but of course external speaker is useful if you want loud base.5mp and flash on both side which made it unique in sub $200. BLU have $220 phone with 13mp both side with android 4.4.Even 3D games plays smooth.I think all my future phone will be BLU since there's risk when buying from new manufactures.I can't wait until they have 6"" phone with android 5.1 or 6.0 for around $150It can use 64gb microSD so I would suggest get relatively fast one sametime and install. If you are not into video, smaller size is fine."

Negative,Do not buy this piece of junk. I bought it thinking it was gonna be great? The camera is awful and is so slow and lags. The operating system is really bad its not a normal android and half the carriers that are supposed to work with this phone don't. I will never buy a phone over the internet again.

Negative,worked on cricket mobile
Negative,I had to return this stupid phone 3 times and it still doesn't deserve a 1 star!!!
Negative,"I got this for my daughter so she would keep her grimy hands off of my nice phone. I sometimes caught her using it while sitting on the pot, and honestly, I'm the only one who gets to use my phone on the pot. I got this but never hooked it up to a phone sim card. It works well. It is a bit slow and laggy and you can tell where money was saved. But, I view it as a disposable phone for her to ruin or drop in the toilet - so I can ruin and drop my own phone in the toilet."
Negative,"Ok so I bought this to replace a Blu Studio 5.5 Quadcore that I've had for a year and a half, and still works but the storage capacity on it was such that I couldn't add more apps, and even if I deleted an app I couldn't add the new one OR the old one back on. I figured I was happy with the Blu phone I had for the most part and this one would be a similar quality. not fancy but great for the price. The phone was defective. It wouldn't read the SIM card I tried to transfer over. It was possible the SIM card had been damaged though... So I bought a new Straight Talk package of the various SIM cards and it still wouldn't read them. I'm now exchanging it in hopes this was a fluke. Once I get the new one I will post an update. But so far I'm disappointed AND out extra money because of the new SIM card I had to buy. Luckily, even though I adjusted my old SIM card from a standard size to a micro size to fit in my new phone, I was able to insert it back in my old phone and my old phone works. Keeping my fingers crossed it will stay in place even though it's smaller now."
Negative,God phone..

Negative,nice phone and for the price I am really impressed
Negative,MY HUSBAND LOVE HIS BLU PHONE THANK U SO MUCH
Negative,"This phone had the makings to be a great budget phone, which it was for about a month or so. The phone has now slowed down so much that it's become unusable. It takes 15 seconds for it to unlock, the Google launcher is extremely lagging, unless your looking for a paperweight with live wallpapers, find another phone."
Negative,For the price...You can't beat it
Negative,For the price this phone is 5 stars for sure.
Negative,"If you don't want to spend a lot of money in smartphone, this is your option."
Negative,Returned since it was too big.. It was like holding an Ipad to my face.
Negative,was perfect
Negative,"This was a gift for my Mom and she loves it. No problems with Cricket service, we had it working in no time...comes with all listed, I have an IPhone and I was impressed!"
Negative,Have to reboot at least 5 times a day!!!
Negative,Exelente
Negative,I am enjoying it.
Negative,GREAT
Negative,very nice phone
Negative,"I am not enamored of smartphones, but I like this one. I've been using it for three months, now, and consider it ma more than adequate replacement for my old Samsung Galaxy. It is big enough that I can read the news on its browser, but small enough to fit into my pocket. All the apps I regularly use (Calendar, phone, text, email) seem to work fine. It's camera is just so-so, but good enough for family snapshots, and everything else is good. The only thing about it's OS that I don't like is it doesn't seem to offer any way to block numbers."
Negative,"Fast, Responsive, No bugs or glitches. Screen looks and feels good. Light weight, but not flimsy."
Negative,I love it.
Negative,Excelente
Negative,"Hi. the phone came physically in good condition, but does not turn, the touch screen does not work. I can not return the phone I get more expensive sending back. What I can do?.then I lost my money and so difficult it is to get in my country"
Negative,This phone would not connect with my service.
Negative,been having trouble this my second order now :(
Negative,"I was very nervous about buying a phone online, however, I was pleasantly surprised at how perfect this phone is!"
Negative,I like it !!!!!very good
Negative,It was used. The cellphone have an account for security copies
Negative,I love this phone!
Negative,Mass up can't talk hang up on people
Negative,excelent
Negative,"This product does not fit, it is wider and longer than the phone. Will be returning it. This review is for the glass screen protector, and not for the phone itself."
Negative,Goood!
Negative,Great
Negative,"Great phone with great value, not a cheap phone.IPS screen is very nice color and wide viewing angle. Resolution is not as high as $800 phones but I don't see any difference.Speed is fast and no lags.On ATT network, I see 4g even though I don't have data. Older international BLU phones does not connect 4g so this new phone is great.To open the case, insert fingernail on gap at bottom right corner and gently wedge open right side about 1/32"" at time toward top.It uses micro sim. Orientation picture inside the case for sim is wrong. Place connectors on bottom and insert clipped corner first.Also when installing screen protector, align front camera hole 1/128"" below centering the camera hole.Soft case is also nice and screen protector are included so that's additional $10 valueMy older 5"" phone was about 1/2"" larger in both directions.Speakers are LOUD but of course external speaker is useful if you want loud base.5mp and flash on both side which made it unique in sub $200. BLU have $220 phone with 13mp both side with android 4.4.Even 3D games plays smooth.I think all my future phone will be BLU since there's risk when buying from new manufactures.I can't wait until they have 6"" phone with android 5.1 or 6.0 for around $150It can use 64gb microSD so I would suggest get relatively fast one sametime and install. If you are not into video, smaller size is fine."
Negative,excellent phone and excellent seller. Thank you very much
Negative,I'm enjoying it
Negative,Excelent! Thankyou......!
Negative,very nice
Negative,Beyond expectations. Excellent phone.
Negative,Love my phone
Negative,Excellent phone
Negative,I bought this phone for my wife and after a few months it randomly shut down and it wont turn on again. Im out the money and im out a phone.
Negative,Returned since it was too big.. It was like holding an Ipad to my face.
Negative,"This phone does not work properly with AT&T service. I spent over an hour on the phone with ATT trying to get it to work right and it just doesn't. Wont even send and receive texts dependably. Then after 2 weeks the screen cracked. The phone looks good, but its junk. Don't waste your money."
Negative,GOOD JOB;
Negative,job well then two weeks off and not lit more
Negative,very nice price for this good phone
Negative,OK
Negative,Very nice phone. Great camera.
Negative,"love it , perfect"
Negative,Love the phone excellent gift for my son. It has great speed and amazing graphics for the price
Negative,The phone was as expected .
Negative,"This is a great phone. I wasn't expecting it to be with all of the features that comes with it. I don't use it with the internet but only to text but I really like it. Fast, efficient and very easy to use."
Negative,Had this phone for about two weeks now. Had a moto g 2nd gen prior and it crashed. So far i really like this phone. My biggest issue is the keyboard does not keep up with me and has a mind of its own. I have the keypress delay set for the longest it will go yet somtimes when i tap a letter i get a number instead. I have to reread what i type to correct the errors. Other than that i love everything else. If the keyboard were better i would give five stars. But as it stands i would say three to four stars since the keyboard is a large part of using the phone.*UPDATE- I have been using this phone just shy of a month and will be returning it. I cannot deal with the keyboard any longer. It has a mind of its own and takes me double to triple the time to write something because i have to go back and correct so much. It has already powered down on its own and deleted all the contacts i added since getting the phone. And i truly cannot express how AGGRAVATING this keyboard really is. Don't waste your money here.
Negative,"I've purchased a few BLU phones before, so when my Studio 6.0 crapped out, I was looking for a cheap alternative. This however was not it. First off I can't imagine why a phone designed to take ""selfies"" won't let you take a pic by pushing a side button. Only way to snap a pic is by pressing the screen. I could live with that but this phone gets far less signal than my previous BLU phones (same SIM, same network). It also drops it's data connection quite often regardless of the amount of bars I have. I also have a lot of trouble dialing calls out with this phone. Usually only 1 out if every 4 attempts actually dial out, and that is usually only after having to restart it, or turning airplane mode on then off again. I love BLU phones, usually my only complaint is the lack of memory, but stay away from this one. The nice specs do not out weigh the sloppy and glitchy signal and connection problems."
Negative,It's OK does the job. I find that the battery drains pretty fast
Negative,i ordered this phone twice and both times the phone refused to charge after working for only a brief time got a refund wasn't worth 95$
Negative,Good
Negative,"I own several higher end gadgets and purchased this as a gift for a family member who just wanted a ""new"" android device. The device stays powered all day long, constantly has service in the North East, and a pretty screen. While it doesn't quite stack up against a Nexus, Galaxy, or iPhone, you cannot argue for the price. Camera is crisp, speakers are loud, and screen is clean! If you're looking for an affordable phone to make calls and share photos, there isn't any need to look further. This was tested on T-Mobile."
Negative,"Love my be phone. Love it betterbthan my old Samsung galaxy ace. Has more memory, easy to use. Has a camera that rivals all point and shoot cameras. Good buy."
Negative,Nothing
Negative,Got it on time. I bought it for my 14 yr old son. He has been using it for a few Months now and so far it has been working great.
Negative,Very good
Negative,really good cell phone
Negative,satisfied with the product
Negative,"My son lost his Galaxy 4 and I bought this to replace it. He loves it. It does everything the Galaxy did and he doesn't see the difference. Works for ATT 4G, in California and it is unlocked so that it can be used anywhere in the world on any GSM system. Awesome."
Negative,Good smartphone
Negative,Just received my Blu selfie and am so loving it just hope to get a male case soon when can this be expected
Negative,Excelent
Negative,Returned since it was too big.. It was like holding an Ipad to my face.
Negative,"This is a replacement phone for my 14yr old son. He told me that he likes the phone a lot, esp the battery life, it seems to go on forever. He is not really a selfie person, but I believe the cameras are ok. It took a while before the signal strength and settings were great on t-mobile but once they got all the kinks worked out, everything worked fine.I might have to get a couple of these as backups for when someone breaks their phone or something."
Negative,Goood!
Negative,"When I first ordered the phone I was kind of skeptical because I've heard of the company, and ""I heard"" of the company but only through reading if you get my drift. So I figure I would try something new...being cheap, won't happen again, believe me. I've had service on it for about a month or so. Worked well for about 2 weeks then it started to freeze up and not cooperate. I thought it was the service (Net10), but the Mrs has the same carrier different phone (LG Risio). To make a long story even shorter. It has very little battery life...one day tops and that's hardly talking on it, mostly text, but when you do talk on it, it gets rather warm in your hands as well as browsing the internet. Takes forever to download the smallest apps. Still acts sporadically even when I receive a text, I literally have to reboot the phone just for it to act right. I could go on forever, but I would have to have copyrights in publishing this book :D"
Negative,"Son loves his phone , just as well as a higher name brand."
Negative,Excelente equipo realmente una maravilla
Negative,Works great!. No complaints yet and I had it for a couple of months already.
Negative,Nice
Negative,This is the third time purchasing this phone good phone.Very loud too
Negative,Arrives on time my mother in law loves her new cellphone and my wife is happy
Negative,Great phone for the price !
Negative,Excellent
Negative,This is my second blu phone and they are much better then my Samsung galaxy s4 active. I absolutely love blu products!!
Negative,I purchased this phone for my daughter and its a great phone with fantastic camera quality. I'm very pleased with this purchase.
Negative,"This was a gift for my Mom and she loves it. No problems with Cricket service, we had it working in no time...comes with all listed, I have an IPhone and I was impressed!"
Negative,daughter loves it
Negative,Very good
Negative,Haven't even had this phone for 3 months and it doesn't charge.. Smh
Negative,Love this phone. Does ever thing those high priced phones do at a fraction of the cost.
Negative,"Came with everything included in description/picture. Very nice and large display, easy to use and fast. Very very affordable and definitely worth the money! The camera was pretty sharp and takes nice images, the front flash was a plus! Ive also noticed the battery seem to last longer than my previous phones which I appreciated. The package it arrived in could of been safer, but everything arrived swiftly. Overal I really reccomend this phone, would be buying more in the near future!"
Negative,"Ok so I bought this to replace a Blu Studio 5.5 Quadcore that I've had for a year and a half, and still works but the storage capacity on it was such that I couldn't add more apps, and even if I deleted an app I couldn't add the new one OR the old one back on. I figured I was happy with the Blu phone I had for the most part and this one would be a similar quality. not fancy but great for the price. The phone was defective. It wouldn't read the SIM card I tried to transfer over. It was possible the SIM card had been damaged though... So I bought a new Straight Talk package of the various SIM cards and it still wouldn't read them. I'm now exchanging it in hopes this was a fluke. Once I get the new one I will post an update. But so far I'm disappointed AND out extra money because of the new SIM card I had to buy. Luckily, even though I adjusted my old SIM card from a standard size to a micro size to fit in my new phone, I was able to insert it back in my old phone and my old phone works. Keeping my fingers crossed it will stay in place even though it's smaller now."
Negative,I am enjoying it.
Negative,Phone was too slow
Negative,Front camera does not work...it is not even recognized.
Negative,phone is good
Negative,Easy to use. Nice look and feel to it. Excellent seller.
Negative,Wonderful
Negative,Gracia
Negative,"Don't recommend it .... One month old and im not getting text, the flash stopped working, an the screen gets blurry... P. O. S phone"
Negative,"Excelente,100% recomendado"
Negative,"text messages sometimes go through, sometimes it takes 5 times, sometimes they do not go through at all.sometimes cant even make a regular call. gave up and are still using the old phone"
Negative,Do not buy this piece of junk. I bought it thinking it was gonna be great? The camera is awful and is so slow and lags. The operating system is really bad its not a normal android and half the carriers that are supposed to work with this phone don't. I will never buy a phone over the internet again.
Negative,Good!
Negative,Excelent...
Negative,"I don't usually right reviews...but this is not a good phone, it froze all the time , when I would look at pictures or play games it would cut off, if I'm on the phone it would call other people or put people on speaker without my knowledge,"
Negative,"I bought this phone in April, but sadly enough i never had the chance to operate this phone. At first i was able to charge the phone for few days, and the phone abruptly turn off and up till today its still off. This is very unfair, i wasted my money on a product that does not work. Please read the reviews before purchasing again from this seller."
Negative,"I brought this phone to address a problem that my girlfriend had with her last phone, namely, short battery life.It has proven to be a great buy. The cameras are both very sharp and clear for a phone cam. and easy to use.The only downside is the onboard memory which is not that good but can be upgraded via an external card. It really is a personal thing as to what each person's expectation is regarding their phone.My girlfriend is very happy with it and therefore I am happy with it.‚Äã"
Negative,No it didn't work with my SIM card and i have virgin mobile which is sprint it dosn't work with Verizon either.
Negative,Very good phone!!
Negative,it dose everything i needed for the price
Negative,:)
Negative,Have to reboot at least 5 times a day!!!
Negative,"Problems with this phone with message and calls, Had to send it back."
Negative,Stay away from this product. I bought thus phone for my mom and it stopped working in 2 months. The touchscreen would not work. Very bad experience.
Negative,"the battery is not good, is hot charging"
Negative,"product in poor condition, not working properly, it overheats and shuts down."
Negative,this phone isnt worth the money. I got it for my wife and the darn thing did a system crash twice. I guess that what I get for buying cheap!
Negative,Excellent
Negative,Very good!
Negative,I'm enjoying it
Negative,MY HUSBAND LOVE HIS BLU PHONE THANK U SO MUCH
Negative,"This phone had the makings to be a great budget phone, which it was for about a month or so. The phone has now slowed down so much that it's become unusable. It takes 15 seconds for it to unlock, the Google launcher is extremely lagging, unless your looking for a paperweight with live wallpapers, find another phone."
Negative,Excellent phone
Negative,hate this phone never buying a phone off amazon again
Negative,Excelent...
Negative,"Good phone. Be careful when buying a case for this phone. I really love this phone, I am going to buy another one for a back up."
Negative,The best price-value i've ever paid
Negative,This is the phone i got for that case so why did not your match them together.
Negative,"I was so disappointed with amazon for letting such a substandard product and such a substandard vendor operate on its website. Amazon is fast loosing customers' trust and loyalty because of products like these.Now coming to this product, I bought it as a gift. The phone came charged with some battery power. It was okay to use. when it got discharged, it never could get charged again and therefore could never turn on again. It was so disappointing that even toy phones work more then a day and this phone didn't even survive a day. (Original battery and charger were used)"
Negative,Excelent!
Negative,great product
Negative,Have had some issues with other BLU phones but so far so good with this phone.One feature that I did not like was the dialer; too much advertising that interferes with the dialing feature. That is my only complaint.
Negative,"All ready, very good."
Negative,Good fone for this money
Negative,No coplaints great phone great value
Negative,"For the price we paid, the performance is excellent! Our daughter is fascinated! The customer service and reply policies in Amazon work perfectly well, quickly and they take your case as if it was their life. Well done!!"
Negative,"The reason I give it one start is the that the touchscreen and keyboard are very bad. When you hit a letter, the letter next to it pops up. This happens about 25% of the time so it is virtually impossible to write even one word without having to go back and make a correction. The Blu R1 is/was a much better phone, but that sadly is no longer available."
Negative,"Amazing phone for a very affordable price, it works fine with my network provider"
Negative,Did not come with sim card!
Negative,Great buy shipping on time
Negative,besides the cam quality i love my phone.....looks exactly like picture.
Negative,fair price but not high performance
Negative,"I order this phone for my mother in law and in the second day of use something was wrong with the screen, some kind of weird lines appear."
Negative,Excellent for my pre paid sim card from t mobile.It has nice cameras u can't beat the price.I got a case and screen protector. Bought a memory card and was good to go. I travel with this phone to the Caribbean and south America and use their sim cards with no problem. Good battery power .
Negative,It's a good phone until you start taking photos and the front camera will freeze if you try to take a photo with the flash on . the memory doesn't hold barely anything. It freezes . the charger the phone came withnstopped charging the phone after day 2. I have bough 7 chargers since I got the phone because after a week it just stops charging. This phone is a rip off. BUYER BEWARE. only gave it 1 star because 0 stars is not an option .
Negative,excellent phone!
Negative,An excellent cellphone... Low price and good perfomance
Negative,Excellent
Negative,All perfect . High quality product
Negative,Great cellphone
Negative,I love it so much that I bought one for my wife.

Negative,"Hi, i live in Ecuador.Good phone...iI feel satisfied.For now I have not had problems, recently I had it in my hands on Friday 5/2016.thanks"
Negative,The best price-value i've ever paid
Negative,Nice phone
Negative,"Excellent Smarthphone, I'll buy more"
Negative,"Actually the phone was way better than expected.I moved from a Samsung Galaxy J2 to this phone and you can actually feel the improvement, despite been almost the same specifications.You may install apps in an external memory card, which makes it even better, as you won't run out of space easily."
Negative,Excellent
Negative,"Really good for the price , phone works excellent"
Negative,"its very glitchy, i think i may of got a defective one because its really slow. i just upgraded from the selfie1 and this is nowhere near as fast. takes like 1minute to get on the internet. im not very happy with my phone."
Negative,Excelente
Negative,This is the phone i got for that case so why did not your match them together.
Negative,The charger does not work. The product is defective.
Negative,Absolutly satisfied! I replace an blu life play that was very good but 3 years used. This new blu selfie 2 is better than my old BLU.
Negative,"I bought this phone for my girlfriend as a birthday gift, and so far, she is loving it. She is using this phone with T-Mobile and I believe its the perfect match."

Negative,fair price but not high performance
Negative,This product won't even lete download anything this phone is 8g.Thats no space so the price this phone is not worth buying at all
Negative,Worst phone I have ever owned. I bought this on July16 and the phone stopped working this morning. I should have realized it was horrible when it would not hold a charge and now it won't charge at all. My phone is completely dead and use able. Now I have to buy a new phone because in my job I cannot be without a phone. My customer and staff cannot get in touch with me. DO NOT buy this phone. It's junk
Negative,excellent
Negative,"Great product, work fine with Movistar Venezuela..."
Negative,"I order this phone for my mother in law and in the second day of use something was wrong with the screen, some kind of weird lines appear."
Negative,"I have been blu follower since years ago, but this time I have to say that it is a shame that I bought this cell phone few weeks ago and now is presenting problems with the charging pin. Where is the quality? The standars? I bought it abroad, I live in Venezuela, and I can't do anything to send it back. Just a shame"
Negative,Excelente
Negative,Great it came exactly how any person would want it great quality it works without a sim card aswell
Negative,"Although this is my first smartphone I have to say that I absolutely LOVE it! As far as I can tell it has all the bells and whistles as most smartphones and it is reasonably priced (what phones SHOULD cost!!). The cameras could be a little better but for the price you justcan't beat it! The battery lasts forever and the quality seems very good. As far as longevity goes, only time will tell. Hopefully it will lastfor a long time. I would definitely buy this phone again."
Negative,üëå
Negative,fair price but not high performance
Negative,excellent phone!
Negative,Phone came promptly. Love this phone. Have bought several for friends & family.
Negative,Very good product

Negative,very good
Negative,Excelente Producto
Negative,muy bueno
Negative,Excellent phone works very well has a long battery life and has every thing needed for a cell phone
Negative,Best bang for my bucks.
Negative,"Very nice phone for the price. It has features that you won't find on some higher priced phones. I like the battery life and the fact that the phone battery can be easily replaced if you need to do that. It is dual sim so you can use with two different phone companies. It is a great unlocked international phone and I have given several as gifts. I would definitely purchase BLU products. They are reliable and look really nice,"
Negative,bueno
Negative,Nicd
Negative,"The product to been of complete satisfaction, it works in a correct way, I want to say that hadta now it expires with the awaited expectations"
Negative,fantastic
Negative,"The first BLU Studio x8 worked maybe a week or so, then was impossible to hold a charge. The charger in the box was a lemon, and I purchased an additional charger and even that would not charge the darn phone. I returned it (very good return policy) and a replacement was promptly sent. The replacement worked great, for 4 days!!! Then, would not hold a charge, the earbud port will not work and apps are nonfunctional. I'm going to send it back!Do not buy this product...it is a big LEMON. I have incurred the expenses of buying extra chargers, a case for the stupid phone and postage back for the case and plug (the plug x 2, as I sent the first one back too)."
Negative,Doesn't have a lot of upgrades and doesn't hold much storage. I couldn't get service in many parts of the building that I work in and the time jumped a lot on it.
Negative,"The phone is great. The holder is perfect. I have not had a smartphone before, so I had to take somewhere to learn some features. I'm getting better as I learn more. I don't have internet at home so only time I can use is when I go to town. It would have been nice to have beginning instructions for the novice user. All in all it is a good phone and I really do like it. Better as time goes on."
Negative,"keyboard light and light LED notification does not work, the phone turns itself off sometimes the battery lasts very little. I am not happy with the phone as for defects that presents not seem to be new"
Negative,It is a gift so my aunt loves it
Negative,Exelent
Negative,Excelent
Negative,Good product!!
Negative,Better than I expected. I bought this as a backup and very please with the look and feel and the smooth operation of this phone.
Negative,daughter loves her new phone..
Negative,good product
Negative,"Great phone, can have a little lag sometimes but I'm okay with that, screen looks great, sound is decent, price is good.But most of all I hard bricked this phone playing around, black screen on boot & was able to fix it."
Negative,EXCELENTE
Negative,"It is really crazy. Signal strength is very weak, I am not able to make any call. Very frustrating experience. At least the product should do the most basic function correctly - which is to make a call. I am going to return it."
Negative,Great phone but only 2G my carrier is going all 4G in January so phone will not work then. But a good phone while I can still use it.
Negative,"The phone was as described, it was unlocked and ready to use. I live in Jamaica and I was able to just put in my sim card and use the phone. It was also received on time. Completely satisfied."
Negative,My mom enjoy her gift from me
Negative,Perfect device
Negative,excellent for the price
Negative,it don't meet my 4G standard and slow. Don't like it.
Negative,great!
Negative,I didn't expect much for $50 but in some ways I like it better than my iPhone....but of course it is not an iPhone. I am using it as a second cell phone with just a prepaid card and I seldom make calls so for my very basic need it is more than I need.
Negative,It suck don't work on 3g I thought I was getting a good phone was wrong
Negative,Great value
Negative,nice neat phone.. reasonable price... working well.. loving it
Negative,"Pros: $50 phoneCons:-Only supports 2g (Edge) No 4g.-Booting times/loading apps is extremely slow-Camera quality is horrible, indoor/outdoor pictures are super grainy/blurry and shutter speed is extremely slow-Sim card slot is horribly designed. Inserting and removing sim card could damage it.-Cheap plastic material"
Negative,My plan has 4g and the phone get 2g so the internet is really slow
Negative,good
Negative,I recently purchased this phone and it's not worse buying at all. Yess its cheap and you get just that. My phone keep shutting off all the time even wen am on a call. Sometime it shut off 4 time back to back. Not worse the buy. üò£üò£üò£üò£üò£üò£
Negative,Excelente cell phone
Negative,Good for the money.
Negative,"I really liked the phone when I received it, it was super light and smooth to use. I bought this phone for my dad and planned to ship it to him after setting it up. I can literally watch battery drain on it within seconds..This is a piece of garbage, what use is any phone if it can't retain battery. So disappointed.."
Negative,"Gave as a gift, and they love their phone!"
Negative,Excelent
Negative,great deal nice phone well worth the $$$$$
Negative,Excelente Producto
Negative,ok

Negative,Excelent!!!
Negative,"It wasn't fast enough, and it didn't have enough apps, also it was difficult to program and wouldn't Stream the Videos fast enough."
Negative,Good product!!
Negative,I am woefully disappointed with this device. It is very light weighted as if it is fake. The screen freezes up every few minutes. The battery doesn't even last all day and I'm not a heavy user. I feel cheated. The weight management pills I can't speak for because they are suppose to control hunger to some degree and I'm not seeing that result as yet. It may still be early

Negative,After putting my Sim card in I no longer have picture messaging
Negative,"I love it, I do recommend it."
Negative,This phone is junk. I havent even had it one month and now it wont go past the bold like us menu. I have tried resetting it amd nothing works. Such a waste of money and now I don't have a phone for the weekend. Lessoned learned not to buy one of these phones.

Negative,Luv it....
Negative,My phone ' is huge and it's just perfect for this great price. I love my phone very much I can do it all with this phone. I'm very glad that I know about Amazon has this great deal with phones. Everyone should get one: )
Negative,"Great features, reception and price."
Negative,I totally love this phone and the price is unbelievable deal for such a phone. The only draw back I can see is there doesn't seem to be a lot of cases for this phone. However it did come with a thin plastic one. I was able to put my card ( T-Mobile prepaid ) into phone and it worked right away.
Negative,I wrote a review when I first had the phone. I was happy with it. After almost 3 weeks the touch screen is starting to not respond properly. The time keeps changing to East coast times. AT&T can't even figure out the issue. My data seems to drop in the middle of task. I am sending this phone back.
Negative,Just as described
Negative,no words
Negative,"I bought this cellphone 3 months ago, it doesn't work at all, if i m on call with this, gets off, even this keep overhot, anda really disppointed with this.I would like to know if this has any garantie??"

Negative,Just Bad!!!
Negative,"Awesome, I love my new phone."
Negative,"VERY GOOD PHONE , AMAZING"
Negative,Great phone
Negative,I would not buy any other phone than this stylish and sleek Blu phone. Not only is this phone thin and light but it has so many pluses that accommodates all you need in a phone. I switched the phone over to my service provider in a matter of minutes. It was that simple and no trouble at all. I simply love it!
Negative,She love's it
Negative,"All I can say at this time is, So far so good! It is replacing another Blu 5.5 Studio I purchased from Amazon about a year ago. But after about 6 months, the video started flickering and running lines through it. So when I saw Blu had an updated Studio XL with a 6 inch screen I jumped on it.Although it has a 6 inch screen, Android 5.0 Lollipop takes the bottom half-inch or so of the screen for the ""buttons"" that used to be fixed below the screen. This is a bad move on their part to advertise a 6 inch screen, but only 5.5 inches viewable. So not much improvement over a 5.5 inch smart phone. Also it should be noted that this is not a HD screen. At 960x540 screen resolution, it is subpar with comparable smartphones in this category, but most are more expensive. It has a beautiful screen non-the-less. But for the average viewer, most will not notice the lower resolution unless using it with Google Cardboard 3D viewing. But I'm sure that is a very small percentage of buyers. I inserted a 64 GB micro SD card which it accepted, formatted and allowed me to transfer most of the installed apps to it freeing up the limited 8 GB of internal memory. I then took the SD card out, inserted it into the adapter, then into my computer slot to fill it up with my tunes, pictures and vids. It plays everything just fine with jetAudio basic for the tunes, VLC Player for the vids, and the included apps for the pics.Recommended!Update 4-6-16Using this phone in Colombia & Panama. Works nice with Claro data plan + minutes for 15 bucks a month in Colombia. & 22 bucks a month for +Mas Movil Panama. Good H+ but no 4G so far in either country. MagicJack app seems to have bug, as folks on other end hear their echo. Don't have that with my iPhone 4s. I will reinstall app to see if newer firmware fixes it. Using Speedtest been getting over 10mgs with H+ in both countries. Another problem I encountered when I first arrived in Panama, was calls & msgs seemed to default to Colombia SIM, even when Panama SIM was chosen as default SIM. So just took out the Claro SIM, as probably Claro has overriding firmware to keep it primary in multi-sim phones. Or at least that's what the +Mas Movil tech says in Panama. So the phone is still hanging in there. No real complaints so far. Still recommended!Update 29 Jun 2016Just returned from the Dominican Republic, used Orange SIM & phone worked beautifully. Also just bought from Amazon the PNY 128 GB micro SD card for less than 30 bucks. Removed the 64 gigabyte SD card from my phone, placed it in its adapter and backed it up in my laptop. Inserted the PNY 128 GB SD card into my phone, turned it on. Phone recognized the new card right away and asked me if I wanted it formatted. Which I did. Turned off the phone removed the new card, placed it in its adapter and put it in my laptop to copy the data back to the new card. Inserted it back into the phone and turned it on. Phone recognized it immediately. So no problem with 128 GB SD card with this phone! More tunes, plus just about every picture I've ever taken!Update: 3 July 16Bought from Amazon the Anker double fast charger along with a six pack of their charging cables. I recommend you don't use that Anker charger with this phone. I had missplaced my original Blu charger and cable and began using a cheap generic charger & cable, but was taking forever to get a decent charge. Maybe 60% overnight. So bought the Anker combo pkg. Works super fast charging this phone, but stops at 99%. Phone started acting up which I determined was due to overheating while charging with the Anker charger. Long story short, found the original Blu charger, and am sticking with it. The Anker cables work great with the Blu charger as does the original Blu cable. Blu charger charges in about 6 hrs to 100%. Stick with the Blu charger and cable!"
Negative,"I'm upgrading from 1 star to 4 because of the high customer service extended to me by [..]after I wrote the following 12 days ago......I'm giving one star because the option for 1/2 isn't available. If you don't mind buying a phone that works perfect for 6 months than starts acting up in every way possible including shutting down for a few days, no longer swipe to take calls, battery getting extremely hot, then this is the phone for you, I bought 3, one fell and the screen shattered and I cant get it repaired, but whats the use I 'm sure it would be behaving the same way as the other 2.BTW I also bought a Pure Life XL that unlike the Studio XL's locked it self down once for 2 days with the battery running very hot, from then on I've had no further problems, Bought all three XL's for 360.00 so I'm figuring I got my moneys worth. A year would have been better"
Negative,Good
Negative,The phone over heated and cracked the screen and doesn't work correctly anymore if i wanted a phone that did that i would have bought the note 7
Negative,Waist of your money don't purchased this item
Negative,This is the best phone ever!!! it's fast to the touch and it responds to all my apps the price was right with this also it looks really niceüò± I love it üòÉüòä

Negative,"Love this Phone. AMAZON youre the one. Great product, Great service."
Negative,"Great phone for its price, really recommend this phone. The only thing I can't fine good screen protectors, and cases. Over all great phone."
Negative,"This is a good smart phone , i liked .. its fast, big and conforable !"

Negative,it's a great phone and very beatiful
Negative,Excellent choice
Negative,"This phone here is Beautiful however that is all it is... now after 5 weeks it drops calls, it says have insufficient funds to place calls which are LOCAL.... The volume suddenly decreased on it's own. and the list goes on. Just tried to return it because I have had it with this phone and I am a week and a half shy of my return time. smh. sucks...... I really HATE this damn phone right now. I am sooooo upset."
Negative,It's good all around no complaints
Negative,Very happy for phone set up and performance.
Negative,Was told this item was unlocked. Phone is not unlocked to work with Verizon in the US. Going to try to return this. 8/ Shame. Would have liked this product probably. Really fudged a birthday.
Negative,Garbage phone
Negative,"This has been a really great phone so far. Just a little bigger than I expected, but it functions very well. Bold Like Us....(BLU) great job!"
Negative,EXCELLENT
Negative,"After my kids have great success and lots of fun using¬†BLU Studio 7.0 II -Unlocked Smartphone - Global GSM - Gold, I decided to finally upgrade my own SmartPhone. I have used my trusty Samsung Galaxy Mini S5570. This phone is small by today‚Äôs standards, and I got it for less than ~$40 but it has served me well for four years and it‚Äôs still chugging along ‚Äúdecently‚Äù. However, AT&T signal seems to be weakening and at times, I will completely lose signal while my wife‚Äôs iPhone will still maintain full signal. So I decided I will be upgrading, and I am looking for a replacement that will last me as long, if not longer.FULL DISCLOSURE: I USE MY OWN MONEY WITH THE PURCHASE.Since BLU‚Äôs 7.0 version is well liked by my family members, I decided to look for another offering from BLU. My gripe with the 7.0 is that it lags a bit in some games, but never bothered the primary user so I know from the start that I will not be buying it. I was torn between the¬†BLU Energy X Plus Smartphone - With 4000 mAh Super Battery- US GSM Unlocked - Silver¬†and¬†BLU Life 8 XL Smartphone - Unlocked - US GSM - White. As I ponder about my replacement, I began to prioritize my needs:‚Ä¢ Must support my current mobile carrier / GSM‚Ä¢ Must be at least 5.5 screen size‚Ä¢ Must have Lollipop OOB or later‚Ä¢ Must have at least 8GB (about 5GB usable internal) storage‚Ä¢ Must have beautiful decent display‚Ä¢ Must have decent battery life (all day usage, ~12hrs active use between call/text/video)‚Ä¢ Must have SD Card slot‚Ä¢ Must have FM radio‚Ä¢ Must be able to support my game without lag (DISNEY Tsum Tsum)‚Ä¢ Preferably with two cameras: Front and Rear (at least 5MP rear)‚Ä¢ Preferably with Dual Band WiFi‚Ä¢ Preferably Less than $200The only reason, which I know is minor for most, that I chose this over Life 8XL / Life is because both of these phones are on Android 4.4. Of course, Amazon says those phones are Lollipop upgradeable but I‚Äôd rather not wait. So other than those reasons, I came up with Studio XL as my choice phone:Specs:= 1.3GHz MediaTek Quad-Core CPU= MALI 400 GPU= 8GB Internal memory [~5.3GB available] / 1GB RAM / MicroSD support up to 64GB= 6‚Äù IPS+ 540x960 (183 ppi) qHD Display= HSPA + 21Mbps / 3G / 4G (No LTE)= 3.00K mAh Non-Removable Battery= 2MP Front & 8MP Rear Camera= Includes Headphones, Screen Protector, Case, 2 Amp Charger, USB CablePlus+ Great value as a phone and tablet (phablet)+ Android Lollipop 5.0+ Factory Unlocked for GSM+ Bright screen+ Great Battery Life+ Fluid UI Performance+ Expandable StorageMinus- Single speaker- No accessories *yet*- Back Slot Cover is very very very tight to open- Resolution is too low even with higher PPIImprovement Required:* Better display, with 540x960, BLU has greatly reduced the sharpness of the videos and pictures displayed on the phone.* More RAM (at least 2GB)* Support for LTE* 5Ghz WiFi Band* Smaller bezelVerdict:I like this phone, and I tried to LOVE it. It is gorgeous, has great battery life, and performs like a champ in the games. It‚Äôs even better than the BLU Studio 7.0 II in gaming. The Phone performed as expeted with Speedtest both in mobile and WiFi. It maintains a strong signal (AT&T Prepaid) even on areas where my Samsung completely lose all signals. I like how the phone feels, and it doesn‚Äôt look cheap. I really like that the phone came with screen protector, and protective case.My biggest issue for this would be the resolution, as the longer I use it, the more I notice the low resolution. In the end, this is a great device as a main phone with huge screen and worth the money."
Negative,I wrote a review when I first had the phone. I was happy with it. After almost 3 weeks the touch screen is starting to not respond properly. The time keeps changing to East coast times. AT&T can't even figure out the issue. My data seems to drop in the middle of task. I am sending this phone back.

Negative,Phones are great!!!!
Negative,It's a really good phone better than I expected
Negative,"This phone is absolutely wonderful. Performs just as well as the expensive guys. Beautiful camera. Love that there was no need to buy accessories. They all came with the phone, including a case. This is a great buy!"
Negative,Nice phone came completely dead take a while to charge
Negative,Unsatisfied
Negative,It doesn't look like how it is
Negative,"Beautiful phone, preloaded with Google app. Price is exceptional great. I had already purchased another one. Plan start $20 and up, no expensive contract."
Negative,Had to go with AT&T but satisfied with the phone
Negative,I've bought a few blu phones I think 7 of them and this piece of crap is the worst can't even hold a phone call without dropping it with full bars.. Very disappointed in this model
Negative,I totally love this phone and the price is unbelievable deal for such a phone. The only draw back I can see is there doesn't seem to be a lot of cases for this phone. However it did come with a thin plastic one. I was able to put my card ( T-Mobile prepaid ) into phone and it worked right away.
Negative,I return this phone it was a good phone until it started to malfunction I can't get a refund on this item I sent back so I quess its a lost for me
Negative,A+++
Negative,He's love it. I purchased it for my boyfriend as a gift
Negative,This phone is awesome..everything worked with T-Mobile perfectly except GPS. For some reason the GPS never knows exactly where I am in reference to the turns. It says turn in 3 miles and when i get to the turn it never picks up when im there...so weird...But phone is still awesome
Negative,Love it. Works great out the box!
Negative,This phone is junk. I havent even had it one month and now it wont go past the bold like us menu. I have tried resetting it amd nothing works. Such a waste of money and now I don't have a phone for the weekend. Lessoned learned not to buy one of these phones.
Negative,Received my studio blue xl two days ago. The first one I purchased I returned because my cell phone provider (T-Mobile) said that they couldn't get the internet to work . so i then went to metro pcs and she said that blu brand type phones have a problem with connecting to the internet through their service. So I sent phone back .then something said order phone again. I did and programmed everything myself!! Instead of taking it to store And also it was a icon u had to click on to connect the internet. Everything works prefect! I love this phone! Cell phone companies just want u to purchase their phones instead of u bringing a phone from the outside
Negative,Perfect
Negative,"On time arrival, product just as advertised."
Negative,Yes
Negative,This phone sucksIt can't run any games and it is always delayed when I type or when I scroll and every once in awhile the phone just doesn't want to charge
Negative,Love this phone it works just like my other phone (Samsung Note 2)
Negative,"i got this phone, i am with t mobile how ever i dont think my old tmobile sim card work for this one, i had a blu studio 6.0 any suggestions on what kind of sims cards i need for this for phone and is there on here i can buy ? info can you comment the name thanks!"
Negative,"Works great. As advertised. 2nd BLU I have owned in 3 years. Plenty of storage for all popular apps and then some. Can't beat it for the price. Get it, you'll be glad you did."
Negative,"I Love this high tech phone, it's just as great as an iPhone."
Negative,I have had two of these phones since January 2016 and neither one works. I will never buy this phone again. I can not return it to Amazon now and that is not fair. Maybe I will reconsider keeping my account since I was treated unfairly.
Negative,Nice Phone
Negative,Great phone for the money.
Negative,"Good battery life, solid design.... Be aware only uses a Micro (phone) and Nano SIM cards (storage). Finding after-market screen protectors is a pain. Few cases available."
Negative,Great phone for the money.
Negative,everything perfect excellent product recommended
Negative,Good phone for price.
Negative,Excelente
Negative,bueno
Negative,"Phone has a ""plastic"" feeling but I like the screen size. Good hand held size and feeling when holding it. But one major issue is that it didn't recognize my t-mobile or lycamobile SIM card. Both SIM cards work fine when I tried with other unlock phones. But this phone just reads ""insert SIM"" and ""Emergency."" This phone is faulty because it can't read my SIM card but I read other comments and they said it works fine with t-mobile SIM card. So, I don't know what's the problem. I'm going to contact seller for replacement or return and also contact t-mobile. I'll update once this issue is resolved either way.UPDATE: Returning this item. I called t-mobile and the tech guy said it's due to the phone not properly unlocked so it doesn't recognize any SIM card. The Blu phones do work with t-mobile but how can you tell if it was properly unlocked. I'm going to get another Blu phone from target or walmart where I can return it in-store. Hoping they have properly unlocked phones there than here with the different sellers at amazon."
Negative,exelente
Negative,"for this price tag ,you cant ask for much more. works as described, long battery. no issues so far. had it 6 months and its done USA, UK and Caribbean without skipping a beat"

Negative,Gr8 phone

Negative,"Bottom Line: It's a cheap phone and made & handled by manufacturer like one. You WILL get frustrated and the phone does NOT justify even the low price tag.Interested in the story?Like most others, I got this phone for the low price - I just wanted it as ""spare"". A few weeks after the phone arrived (in May 2014), I realized one of the SIM ports didn't work but I didn't bother because I needed only one. Another month or so and the last remaining port also stopped working. Well, fine! I will contact customer service and they will help, right? Nope! It is a cheap phone, it's built like one and also treated that way by the manufacturer.Many email exchanges to prove to them that a) the phone indeed doesn't work, b) those SIMs do work in other phones and c) send them invoice, phone IMEI details and waht not. Fast forward a few weeks and they asked me to ship it to them - WITHOUT A SHIPPING LABEL! The cost of the the phone immediately went up by 15$s! Well, ok! 40-odd $s for a spare phone is still not too bad.Add another 2-3 weeks and I was notified I will get a new phone. Fast forward to early this year and I receive another notification that the phone was undeliverable and I'd have to pay 10$ for them to reship it! When i asked them the question - about the cost of all this becoming more than that of the phone itself - I was quoted ""company policy"". That was the end of that as I decided to save my 10$s. My final message to them ""Please feel free to keep the phone. I am not prepared to spend another 10$s (hence totaling 50$s) on a phone that was initially for 25$s.""Add to it the hours spent on email and postage and the cost of not having a phone...."
Negative,"This is a wonderful masterpiece of 21st century's high technology. I've got a tv receiver that works so great I feel I'm living in the Jetsons cartoon world. I am very glad with my tv cell phone and the good service provided by Amazon. I highly recommend blu because truly delivers quality at low cost. Buy this device, it is the best analog tv ever."
Negative,Simple and cheap
Negative,Thank you so much we badly need this kind of phone and working great!

Negative,cool

Negative,Excellent...
Negative,"I purchased this phone strictly as a backup while I'm between smart phones. It makes and takes calls as you'd expect, but unfortunately, no matter how hard we try, it's impossible to stop the barrage of text and multimedia messages. A simple multi recipient message was all it took to make this phone go completely crazy.The phone does not have facebook and social media functions like the description said. Again, it's just a backup, so that's OK. The TV function doesn't work. Again, just a backup phone, so no loss. It doesn't recognize all my ringtones. Again, it's a backup... you get the idea.Where I drew the line was when a simple message caused it to receive gibberish text messages at a rate of two to three a minute. I could no more put the phone down than it would ring again, and there would be more gibberish coming from the same source. Adding that source to the phone's blacklist did nothing to help--the ""messages"" came through even FASTER.I plugged my SIM cards into an unlocked Android, set up the APN, and the group message showed right up as it was meant to.IF you can convince your friends to never text you again, maybe this phone would be a good choice if you wash your Android like I did. IF you could disable text messaging on this phone (or through your provider), then maybe this would be a good spare phone.If all you want is a simple, basic, phone that makes and takes calls, then go buy that phone over there instead."
Negative,"I needed a phone while traveling overseas. This thing is absolutely perfect. $29 shipped, are you kidding?Takes pictures, has a rather good FM radio, holds the charge fantastic, and most importantly it's a telephone. Takes two sims and a memory card. Yes, it isn't a $800 smart phone, but I wouldn't cry for it if I lost it or got pickpocketed. BLU nailed this one. For $29 it's an easy 5 stars."
Negative,"For those of you looking for the most basic features in a phone, you can hardly get any more basic than with this phone. I bought the BLU Tank 3 T430 for its lack of features, long battery life, and low price. It doesn't have anything I would never use in a phone.All I want is to place and receive calls and do simple texting. It has a one-name-one-number contact list without the possibility of adding a birthdate, email, or other useless information. I really like its blacklist feature.I first transferred my contact information to the SIM card using my old phone before inserting the card into my new phone. Once the card is inserted, you can copy your information to the phone's memory. I just left my contacts on the SIM card since SIM cards have a capacity for 250 contacts, and this phone's memory is limited to 100 contacts.It has an FM radio which is nice to have, though unnecessary. It has an auto search feature which will pick up all FM radio stations in your area. You can then edit the name of each station if you wish. Don't count on quality pictures and videos with its VGA camera. It can play audio and video files located on a mini SD card.Opening the back cover is easy if you can get your fingernails in the slot located on the lower right side. It's easy enough to insert a SIM card in the SIM1 slot using the metal tray which has a pull tab on its left side. I didn't try the SIM2 slot. The battery has no pull tab, but comes off easily enough. There's a slot for a mini SD card which you will need to insert should you want to take pictures and videos.Overall, I'm very satisfied with my new phone. It has fewer features than my nine year old flip phone, but one major plus with this phone is that it has no moving parts other than the keypad buttons. I like its big display area, pleasant colors, and loud speaker. I recommend it to anyone who is not technical and has no use for a smartphone, and to anyone who travels frequently. Its dual SIM card capability means you never need to open the back cover again."
Negative,"Opened the package, turned it on and tried the functions. Within 1 minute it caused me a headache (physically), so I returned the phone within 5 minutes. Had to pay for the shipping, though. I am not going to buy any unfamiliar phone brand online since there is no way to try it."
Negative,"this phone is amazing ... It is super fast, good design ... I made a good buy. the only problem is the battery"
Negative,"Took to T-Mobile for Sim and the agent was floored by the value of this Phone !This phone performs like phones twice the cost, has amazing features and an Outstanding package.Android 4.1 and works 3G on T-Mobile right out of the box.have tested most of the features and it is as billed Flawless phone and service!Missed T-Mobile after being on hind tit Sprint (Virgin) never never again..Nothing but Smiles !!Edit: Battery life is 48 Hrs. + fairly heavy first days use."
Negative,ok
Negative,Good Phone and Perfect Condition
Negative,Excelent product
Negative,"I bought this for my father who just needed a basic phone. He loves it, it works well and AT&T had no problem helping him set it up. As written by others, the manuals are fairly useless and are written in a micro-font. They don't have all of their manuals on line but I managed to find one close enough that I was able to email him and he used that. So overall the product is great but the documentation not so much."
Negative,"The phone just works!Pros: Long battery life, simple, light, easy to use, loud and clear.Cons: Plastic is not the best, menu could be more logical.Overall, it's a great phone. Once you figure out the menu system and don't drop it."

Negative,"Item received. Phone is unlocked on description.I have an international sim card, but I get an ""invalid sim"" on the screen when I turn the phone on."
Negative,"Well, but its performance are limited"
Negative,Very nice with cheap price love it
Negative,Not bad
Negative,Very mobile
Negative,"Now I have not used it yet overseas, so I don't know if it will work. But I think that will have more to do with the SIM card than the phone itself. It picked up the local network and works fine. Inserting the SIM takes some finesse and fingernails but is not too difficult. The buttons have a good feel to them. The radio is surprisingly clear for FM. Play around with it and you will eventually figure out how to make things work."
Negative,"battery life is amazing all the features i want in a phone, menus are a bit weird but for under $25 this is excellent value for money"
Negative,very good
Negative,Excelente
Negative,love this little phone worked perfect Thanks
Negative,"phone works very well, and is better than I thought for a dumbphone, purchased it because blu tank 193was rated as one of the best in this class, set it up with cricket and pretty much straight forward, it needsa sim card in order to work, it comes with none. you can install sim card from another unlocked phone andit will work with this phone if original phone was gsm networked. the phone does have several ring tones to choose from. andsecond sim slot is for another phone carrier, towards the top of the phone under the cover, there is a sdhc slot for storing customized ringtones and other stored media, you need to provide the sdhc micro card yourself, overall very impressed."
Negative,well I recommend
Negative,"Garbage. It's a toy. I'm in Europe and didn't work in France, the Netherlands or Spain. I will return it as soon as I get back to the USA."
Negative,excelente
Negative,"Honestly, we didn't expect much from this phone considering how cheap it is. My husband wanted to downgrade from a smartphone, but this is useless. First, the directions were vague and not helpful. Secondly, it gets terrible reception and calls sound pretty bad. It doesn't have T9 which makes having a low tech phone pretty tedious. Also, the SIM is nearly impossible to take out. Not good if you're using it as a temporary phone."
Negative,I bought two of these phones! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THEM!Half the time when I call my parents they can't hear me because the phone goes in and out. When they answer it the radio goes on. If it had a Zero star rating it would get that instead of this one star. Disappointed üëéüèª
Negative,"Product description states the phone to be an unlocked GSM phone. I inserted my active AT&T Sim card and it didn't recognize it. It comes up as""Emergency"". I put a T-Mobile non-active sim and it found that network. They count on people not bothering to return it because it's a ""hassle"" just for $20. I don't care if it's ""only"" $20. I don't like giving my hard earned money away for no good reason. Amazon, you need to vet these vendors more carefully."
Negative,works perfectly
Negative,"Couldn't hear anyone during phone calls, it sounds like the speaker is tucked away somewhere deep inside the phone and what you get is a low muffled distorted sound where you cant make out what people our saying. I had to use speaker and it was still very difficult to hear. Also had no little to no service with ATT to where I couldnt even make outgoing calls while my iPhone next to it had full bars. Sending it back and getting an ATT Go Phone."
Negative,"Terrible thing! It takes big knife or screwdriver to open battery cover. People who are married with their phones can probably guess how it opens, but manual does not describe it. Tried many tricks, big knife was the only successful. Will throw it away, to cheap to return."
Negative,very good
Negative,Great for taking on vacation overseas and having chip installed at the local carrier.
Negative,"Bought this for my preteen, bad idea. This phone works when it wants to. It doesnt receive calls at times, other times we have to restart the phone just to make an outgoing call."
Negative,excelente producto...........

Negative,"Great phone for the price. Came super early. Comes with english, Spanish and Portuguese languages."
Negative,excellent product. It works perfectly in Venezuela
Negative,Looks like a toy phone. Had hard time opening the cover to access the SIM tray. Also the box arrived missing a USB cable. Product was returned.
Negative,"Very nice little phone. I got this for my 74 year old mom that is not comfortable with a smartphone. She has been wanting a phone that has the numbers at the bottom, and this is perfect. She loves it. Its very small works great. Its unlocked so that made things a whole lot easier. This phone would be great for older people that don't want the smartphone. Its lightweight and easy to use. I am very pleased with this phone. I received this phone at a discounted price for my unbiased and honest review. Highly recommended."
Negative,excelente
Negative,Pretty good phone. The battery is the best feature. It last almost two weeks on normal use.
Negative,excellent product thanks
Negative,"fast shipping, good!!"
Negative,"Great product, exactly what i expected. Great price"
Negative,"I bought this phone in anticipation of replacing my very old quad band phone that I use for asia and europe. The price was good, and in spite of the poor reviews I decided I'd give it a try. Big mistake. The first one wouldn't hold take a charge, so I asked for a replacement. Same problem. This phone is useless. I guess I'll go to best buy and get one that actually works. Don't waste your money or time, and especially don't waste your frustration on this useless piece of plastic. You need to remove it from your roster. It only gives Amazon a bad name."
Negative,It's a tank makes calls and do not need to worry about breaking it
Negative,It is very good !

Negative,fine
Negative,It has a great feel for such an inexpensive phone. Great functionality and precisely what I was looking for. Great phone as a back up or if you don't have the money for an expensive one.
Negative,I hate the phone because the sound is very bad
Negative,"This phone is $20. I'm dumbfounded by the reviews that complain it doesn't have this or that. Let's be real, this is a backup / emergency / throwaway phone and that's all it is. If you want it for that purpose, it does every thing you need. If you plan on using this day in and day out as a prepaid phone, you're going to want to go with something with a little more features. This phone has a 30 day standby battery life and it sits in my emergency bag. That's exactly what this phone is for. The controls are not slick, the construction sucks and is cheap, and the sim card is hard to remove, but honestly, if I ever had to use this and the time on that card, chances are I'd drop another 20 bucks for a new one. Here's to telling it like it is and not complaining about an imperfect phone that doesn't live up to an iPhone for twenty bucks."

Negative,Dead after 2 days.

Negative,Excelente
Negative,"Picked this up to use for a teen who isn't ready for a smartphone. It's exactly what it says on the box - a simple basic phone. Makes calls, slows down a teen's text-happy hands (they don't often appreciate those who came before them not having QWERTY input for texting); and does it all in a package that can be readily used with t-mobile's $3/month pay as you go plan. Hard to go wrong when you need something basic that can make a call in an emergency, and last forever doing it."
Negative,Good

Negative,"Bought this for my grandfather wanting something basic that he can't mess up. And that is exactly what this is. Very easy to use. Slightly flimsy, but it's a $20 phone so no sweat. Do note you will need a micro SD card to be able to take amd save any pictures."
Negative,"Battery life absolutely sucks compared to the Tank 1. Sure the slightly bigger screen is nice, but I have to charge it every other day compared to once a month! Really tempted to return it"

Negative,"Great battery life. Easy to use. This is a great phone and radio. Don't expect to take pics, videos, etc....I was away for two weeks with hardly any power. I was able to use the phone, make numerous calls, without charging."
Negative,Good
Negative,Excellent seller recommend
Negative,Got this for my grandparents who use AT&T and because this is GSM unlocked it worked like a charm. Very simple for the user that really just needs a phone for emergency situations and the occasional text.
Negative,"I don't know what to say other than for the price you're paying you cant go wrong with the purchase. Don't expect much. It does not use Micro-SD sim card, but it does accept Micro-SD memory card."
Negative,Great phone for elderly people.
Negative,IT'S A GOOD PHONE !
Negative,Its simple but great. The battery runs for a week. Much better than the smart phones for the basic functionality though
Negative,"Fine, I like this product"
Negative,"I give this a one because it looked pretty, but I can't give it anything more because the battery didn't fit so I have NO IDEA what ever works or how it might work."
Negative,"Easy, Easy, Easy. Good"

Negative,I loved it! I only need this phone for my roaming SIM card and I am very satisfied. üòçüòçüòç
Negative,"Battery last forever. it last like 25 days on standby mode with some use. i bought because I live in Mexico and work on the USA and down here my american phone works, but sometimes when getting a service live internet you need a Mexican phone number. I try virgin mobile mexico and works fine. I was surprise and lough that for being so cheap at $ 20 it came with a camera and camcorder(cheap VGA) FM radio, flash, mp3 player king of big screen good call quality. I have forgotten how the old pones battery lasted. since i only use for some especial moments and want it something that the battery will last all day long. Maybe humanity needs to go back to this phone. Im 28 years and spend too much time on my Smart phone jejeje."

Negative,Nice phone for elderly and younger children.
Negative,Bought it for a trip to Africa. Did exactly what I wanted it to do. I could text and call by buying a local sim card and purchasing minutes as needed.
Negative,excellent
Negative,Value for money
Negative,"This phone is cheap, plus it has dual-sim features, which I thought it's way too good to be true until I bought it and tried it out myself when I'm oversea as my phone was locked with a carrier in the US. I had no problem using it at all although I felt like I went back in time. If you think about getting a phone for your little kids without worrying about them going on all of those social media sites or focus too much on playing games, this is the product that you want to get."
Negative,my order arrived in perfect condition
Negative,Everything was as I expected it to be
Negative,"I wanted to like this phone (which we gave to my mother-in-law), but unfortunately, it's not reliable. Our calls drop after a minute or two of conversation (and no, it's not the carrier, since my father-in-law has great reception in the same house). If you're looking for a reliable phone, pick something else."
Negative,GOOD
Negative,WINE WITH PHONE CHARGER DAMAGED
Negative,I got this phone for my daughters. Is a perfect little phone and cheap enough in case they break it or lose it. Everything in it works and I was able to use it for cricket wireless with no problems. I got it in pink and white. No problems with battery life or putting in the sim card. Just read the instructions.
Negative,Great little phone for our trip to Thailand. Worked great.
Negative,Great phone for the money......... I got a second one just to use as an MP3 player.
Negative,"the phone works, if you don't try to insert sim card different way"
Negative,"Not at all as described. Description called this an ""unlocked gsm phone"" but when I got it, it appeared to be set up for t mobile. I needed something actually unlocked, as I have att. Took it to the att store, and of course it didn't work. Forgot the box at the att store, so i can't return it, but I'm not sure it's even worth it anyway. Extremely disappointed. Complete waste of time and 20 bucks. Would rate as 0 stars if possible."

Negative,Veri Nice
Negative,"Good durable phone, worked nicely with long battery life for basic text/call features."
Negative,Never had a problem with it. Worked well with a sim that I bought from another country.
Negative,"The phone was returned, thank heavens. The phone calls were static and unclear due to the cheap quality of this device. Perhaps in an emergency situation it would be ok but otherwise it's a complete waste of money."
Negative,"Completely satisfied. This phone comes with two SIM slots. I am using one domestically on AT&T as my carrier. This will be kept on my bicycle, as a backup phone for when I need to call for help if my bicycle is diabed.For the second SIM slot, I plan to use it when I travel internationally. I will pick up a SIM card locally, and use it when I am abroad.So far, the phone is working exceptionally well. The battery life is amazing. I charged it once, at the beginning. Now more than three weeks later, it is still fully charged. Amazing!"
Negative,Excellent article. Thank you!

I charged it that night. full charged it, took off the charger and turned on airplane mode. there are 3 bars of battery on at full. it is now august 2nd. I still have 3 bars of battery left.

Negative,A definite 5-stars! It works with 2 Sim-cards and a memory card. You can expand the media function by increasing your memory card volume.
Negative,Good phone for the price. Battery will last 4 days to 1 week approx.
Negative,"This phone is good for basic quick calls or a simple short text. PROS: cheap, it works, looks decent, the construction is fairly sturdy. CONS: not very user friendly, has no instruction manual, you cannot hear the phone ring even in a fairly quiet room, the alarm on its loudest is faint from a short distance, the cell reception is very poor with constant dropped calls making it not good for long conversations. I would not recommend buying this phone unless you just need it for an emergent situation, but even then you will be struggling to get a good signal and your conversation will blip in and out making it hard to for whom ever is listening to understand you."
Negative,"the phone works, if you don't try to insert sim card different way"
Negative,"Very basic phone, but as we know, smart phones drain batteries like vacumes, as a result, its a good thing to have one of these dual Sim lifesavers as a backup. Standby is about three weeks????? I'm verifying that now. No crazy apps to deplete the precious energy you need while hiking and lost."

C'mon people, you get what you pay for. I'm buying this as a gift to my extended family in Nigeria and I have bought 3. So far it arrived today, I was too curious to see how it works or what's in it I opened it up and I get the complaint about the tiny space you stick your finger to open it, but for me with arcrylic nails I had no problems opening it and then I messed around with the button to turn it on found it on the top far right hand side, I love this cutie, it has an inbuilt FM radio people!!! It has a race car game for kids or adults alike and it's pretty much decent for its price, I will be buying more as a gift to my folks I added my SIM card and I made a call to a friend it works, battery was fully charged on arrival, no ear piece but it has a wall charger and USB.

Negative,This is a foreign language phone. It has no proper operating instructions. I can find no way to change the language to English. So it is useless to me.
Negative,"It is cheap and Amazon got it to me very quickly. Other than that, it's terrible. I'm on AT&T and have never had reception problem with any of my other phones, but this one drops almost every call upon answering the phone and at times I can't dial out. Doesn't get much worse than that for a phone."

Negative,Simple and cool worth the price
Negative,"I bought this phone a couple of weeks ago. It got here quick, I went on You Tube and saw a couple of videos on how to set it up and install the Sim card, did the 1st time 24 hour battery charge, and it has been running fine ever since. If all you need is a basic phone and don't need the internet or other stuff, then this is perfect. The battery keeps its charge almost forever. For about $20, you can't beat it."
Negative,excelente
Negative,very good love it very much
Negative,I got this phone for my daughters. Is a perfect little phone and cheap enough in case they break it or lose it. Everything in it works and I was able to use it for cricket wireless with no problems. I got it in pink and white. No problems with battery life or putting in the sim card. Just read the instructions.
Negative,"Your product's description said that your phone is open but in truth the phone is not open at all as it does not work in the Caribbean. It was a waste of my money and now that I have return back from vacation, I am learning that I can no longer return it to you. Very unfair. I guess this is how you make your money."
Negative,Do not buy!Bad reception.Very poorly designed. Very hard to open the battery case-almost broke my nails.Seems very cheap and nonfunctional.
Negative,Battery life last so log but need to buy SD card or you won't be able to take any photos.
Negative,Very good no-worry phone for my middle-school daughter.
Negative,"Great cheap phone... It supports 2 sim cards... Worked with Telcel from Mexico. Good quality for the price, battery is pretty good on this thing. I would highly recommend a low cost backup phone."
Negative,No reception. Worst idea ever
Negative,"Honestly, we didn't expect much from this phone considering how cheap it is. My husband wanted to downgrade from a smartphone, but this is useless. First, the directions were vague and not helpful. Secondly, it gets terrible reception and calls sound pretty bad. It doesn't have T9 which makes having a low tech phone pretty tedious. Also, the SIM is nearly impossible to take out. Not good if you're using it as a temporary phone."
Negative,"Product description states the phone to be an unlocked GSM phone. I inserted my active AT&T Sim card and it didn't recognize it. It comes up as""Emergency"". I put a T-Mobile non-active sim and it found that network. They count on people not bothering to return it because it's a ""hassle"" just for $20. I don't care if it's ""only"" $20. I don't like giving my hard earned money away for no good reason. Amazon, you need to vet these vendors more carefully."
Negative,Excelent!
Negative,"Couldn't hear anyone during phone calls, it sounds like the speaker is tucked away somewhere deep inside the phone and what you get is a low muffled distorted sound where you cant make out what people our saying. I had to use speaker and it was still very difficult to hear. Also had no little to no service with ATT to where I couldnt even make outgoing calls while my iPhone next to it had full bars. Sending it back and getting an ATT Go Phone."
Negative,"I bought this phone to use it in Venezuela so I can leave my SmartPhone at home. It works great with Movilnet and Movistar. Very basic, just as I wanted, 100% recommended."
Negative,ok
Negative,We used this phone in Jamaica. It was perfect for this with Digicel service
Negative,Excelente
Negative,Great Item.
Negative,"Now I have not used it yet overseas, so I don't know if it will work. But I think that will have more to do with the SIM card than the phone itself. It picked up the local network and works fine. Inserting the SIM takes some finesse and fingernails but is not too difficult. The buttons have a good feel to them. The radio is surprisingly clear for FM. Play around with it and you will eventually figure out how to make things work."
Negative,Excellent
Negative,Excellent retail management.
Negative,"Good phone, but is very hard to open it."
Negative,Perfect - simple and cheap.
Negative,"phone works very well, and is better than I thought for a dumbphone, purchased it because blu tank 193was rated as one of the best in this class, set it up with cricket and pretty much straight forward, it needsa sim card in order to work, it comes with none. you can install sim card from another unlocked phone andit will work with this phone if original phone was gsm networked. the phone does have several ring tones to choose from. andsecond sim slot is for another phone carrier, towards the top of the phone under the cover, there is a sdhc slot for storing customized ringtones and other stored media, you need to provide the sdhc micro card yourself, overall very impressed."
Negative,"cant beat the price, works great"
Negative,"Bought this phone to use overseas and it worked perfectly. Just inserted sim card and it worked like a charm. I didn't need a lot of apps so it worked for the basics. Would not work for viber, whatsapp and other such apps."
Negative,5 stars
Negative,EXCELENTE

Negative,and repair the mobile changes your publication because they are not released ok
Negative,Great for taking on vacation overseas and having chip installed at the local carrier.
Negative,"Basically it's very good cellphone. The functions of calling and text work very well. However, my BLU Tank II phone haven't turned on anymore since just a month passed. I think the reason why it does not turn on is the buttery trouble. It still a month since I've bought. I cannot return and replace my phone because of Amazon return policy. I am very disappointed. Therefore I cannot recommend this one, and I do not want anyone to make a same mistake."

Negative,A definite 5-stars! It works with 2 Sim-cards and a memory card. You can expand the media function by increasing your memory card volume.
Negative,great phone supper value
Negative,I bought this phone in Nov of 2015 and it hasn't been a year yet and the screen got black it's not working anymore. I would like to return it since is still eligible for the year guarantee.
Negative,the best phone I've ever had so far

Negative,EXCELENTE
Negative,bueno
Negative,"Great product, exactly what i expected. Great price"
Negative,"I bought this phone in anticipation of replacing my very old quad band phone that I use for asia and europe. The price was good, and in spite of the poor reviews I decided I'd give it a try. Big mistake. The first one wouldn't hold take a charge, so I asked for a replacement. Same problem. This phone is useless. I guess I'll go to best buy and get one that actually works. Don't waste your money or time, and especially don't waste your frustration on this useless piece of plastic. You need to remove it from your roster. It only gives Amazon a bad name."
Negative,This phone does not have T9 texting. Everytime you turn the phone on you must reset your private settings (not time and date).The pict on amazon makes it look a lot more sleak then it really is.The phone does not have any of its own memory for picts and videos.There are a few other fitures it is lacking as well.If you want it ONLY for talking even if it will be a hassle to use then this is the one to buy
Negative,excellent product thanks
Negative,exellent
Negative,Very good price and very good phone..
Negative,"Oh this is the best ""old-style"" phone I've ever had. It doesn't do much but for what it does, it does perfectly.The radio isn't garbage, It can read 16gb micro-sd cards, its got a basic file system."
Negative,What is the warranty policy? Purchased at end of July but never used it. It does not power on.

Negative,A1
Negative,"Beatiful and good quality, I received what was bought. Seller is recommended by me."
Negative,Came from using a Sony Xperia Z3. Received this phone yesterday and I am very pleased. For a basic phone this is a great value. The dual sim feature is also helpful so that I can have both my personal phone line and work phone line on one device. I feel as if I am too smart for a so called 'smart' phone. Having a smaller device as well as no fear dropping this as it will probably take me throwing it at the ground to actually cause noticeable effects to be a better trade off. Viva less stress!
Negative,Very tint phone n not user friendly
Negative,After a month or so it started messing up thinking it has the earphone jack plugged in. Now I have to always put it on speaker phone to take a call. I tried everything to fix it and it still shows the monkey with the headphones on.
Negative,ok
Negative,Good
Negative,Fast shipping. Works great in Cuba
Negative,Excellent
Negative,thank you
Negative,"very good phone, also price is good too"
Negative,"I just got this phone and this review is based on my first impressions. This phone gives you a lot for the money. You cannot compare it to the Nokia phones at the same price range. The software/screen/extras are way better. FM radio is a blast! Very clear even without any external headset. In contrast, my new Moto G 2015 does not give you this good reception without a headset. Display is very nice - big, bright, smooth and colorful . Navigation is quite intuitive after 5 minutes playing with the phone. Performance is good. I cannot comment on its call performance since I am only using it with an international sim to receive text messages. The cover is very easy to remove but I found the battery pretty hard to remove. The manual does not indicate how to load the SIM though there is impression embedded near the SIM card compartment. I used a video on YouTube to confirm that I was doing it correctly. Hint - Insert the first sim all the way in until it is flush with the border. Link to video - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7nqUw0g7QMI think the phone back could be more textured to give a better grip."

Negative,"Picked this up to use for a teen who isn't ready for a smartphone. It's exactly what it says on the box - a simple basic phone. Makes calls, slows down a teen's text-happy hands (they don't often appreciate those who came before them not having QWERTY input for texting); and does it all in a package that can be readily used with t-mobile's $3/month pay as you go plan. Hard to go wrong when you need something basic that can make a call in an emergency, and last forever doing it."

Negative,"Good purchase. I bought to use with Movistar, Venezuela. It fit perfect in my pant pocket. Battery is good."
Negative,"I bought this phone for my elderly father in law. The battery life seems rather amazing and the phone seems easy enough to use. However, the FM radio comes on way too easy. Like, every time I use the center toggle. Every time. Rather than have my father in law come to my office 72 times a day to have me turn off the radio, I will throw this in a drawer to use if and when I'm ever in a pinch for a temporary phone."
Negative,"Good ""burner""phone. No complaints."
Negative,Great backup phone.
Negative,Simply will not work at all. Not worth the trouble of trying to return it. Junk. Avoid.

Negative,"Even better in real life,screen is bigger"
Negative,got it for mom she loves it
Negative,"I'm not a prepper, but I wanted an ""emergency"" phone with a long-lasting battery just in case. If something happens, I put my sim and the battery in, and can stay connected for a week. In addition, most phones with FM radios require headphones to serve as the antenna. This phone can play FM without needing any extra wires. As far as functionality, it makes calls and texts fine. The menus are a little bit hard to navigate, and it does have bluetooth."

Negative,"Battery last forever. it last like 25 days on standby mode with some use. i bought because I live in Mexico and work on the USA and down here my american phone works, but sometimes when getting a service live internet you need a Mexican phone number. I try virgin mobile mexico and works fine. I was surprise and lough that for being so cheap at $ 20 it came with a camera and camcorder(cheap VGA) FM radio, flash, mp3 player king of big screen good call quality. I have forgotten how the old pones battery lasted. since i only use for some especial moments and want it something that the battery will last all day long. Maybe humanity needs to go back to this phone. Im 28 years and spend too much time on my Smart phone jejeje."

Negative,"Completely satisfied. This phone comes with two SIM slots. I am using one domestically on AT&T as my carrier. This will be kept on my bicycle, as a backup phone for when I need to call for help if my bicycle is diabed.For the second SIM slot, I plan to use it when I travel internationally. I will pick up a SIM card locally, and use it when I am abroad.So far, the phone is working exceptionally well. The battery life is amazing. I charged it once, at the beginning. Now more than three weeks later, it is still fully charged. Amazing!"

Negative,I like this cellphone.
Negative,I hate the phone because the sound is very bad
Negative,"This phone is $20. I'm dumbfounded by the reviews that complain it doesn't have this or that. Let's be real, this is a backup / emergency / throwaway phone and that's all it is. If you want it for that purpose, it does every thing you need. If you plan on using this day in and day out as a prepaid phone, you're going to want to go with something with a little more features. This phone has a 30 day standby battery life and it sits in my emergency bag. That's exactly what this phone is for. The controls are not slick, the construction sucks and is cheap, and the sim card is hard to remove, but honestly, if I ever had to use this and the time on that card, chances are I'd drop another 20 bucks for a new one. Here's to telling it like it is and not complaining about an imperfect phone that doesn't live up to an iPhone for twenty bucks."
Negative,excellent
Negative,GOOD

Negative,YES...
Negative,"Bought 2 over 6 months, both had sim card issues where it would just stop reading the sim. Still powers on, but no sim detected. Tested sims over multiple other devices. This just has a poor, flimsy construction. It's a cheap travel/beater phone for short term use."
Negative,ok
Negative,Worked great for the two seconds I needed it too. Used it to configure my T-Mobile SIM card for my security system. Had 3 SIM CARD PORTS!!!!!! 2 regular size and 1 micro! impressive!
Negative,I have been using this phone for the past 2 weeks in Jamaica with only 1 sim in it. Every couple of minutes the phone keeps says ita searching for Sim or asking for sim to b inserted. When I try to make calls sometimes the calls don't go and it goes back to saying that its searching for a network.
Negative,"You can't by a brand phone for a lower price! $20 is a great, great bargain. This is my second BLU phone and it definitely doesn't disappoint. I've purchased this phone for a elderly person and I had a very good surprise that is the keyboard size and ergonomy, with individual keys - not that usual flat keypad. Battery is another good point.The only aspect I didn't think it was positive was the UI (user inteface) that is not very intuitive, again, considering the use by an elderly person.I'm so happy with this phone that I will buy another one in a few days, if the price is still the same.*PS: It work just fine on the US T-Mobile and overseas."
Negative,is very good
Negative,Bought this for my old man. Works great on the GSM network in St Lucia. Large keys that he can see and simple enough for daily use.

Negative,"Have dropped it 3 times. One time I tried to catch it and made it fly across the room landing on tile flooring hard enough to pop the back cover off and have the battery come out. The phone still works fine. People say my voice is very clear. The signal is strong and the battery will probably last until the sun explodes. The 2 SIMS, USA & UK, work fine. If you just want a no frills cell phone that works, not a SKYNET Terminator phone that is about to become self-aware and shank you in your sleep, this is it."

Negative,These phones were cheaply made and came with little or no instructions..I'd return them but it cost as much as I paid for them...
Negative,EXELENTE
Negative,"I am probably one of 0.0001% of people in the world who don't want or need a smart phone and don't want to spend hundreds of dollars a month just to be able to talk on the phone now and then and send a text or two. This phone is exactly what I need. No frills, just basic unlocked phone service.I have a legacy T-mobile pay-as-you-go SIM card which, as long as I buy $100 worth of minutes once a year, ends up costing me $8.33/month (they don't offer this to new customers any more, sadly). That, together with this $20 phone, satisfies all my calling needs. Awesome! Also, it's quad-band GSM, so can be used wherever I go around the world. No annoying contracts, no big telecom companies dictating what I can and cannot do with my phone.As for the phone itself, it seems pretty rugged. I was worried that for $20 it would be flimsy, but it's quite OK in that department. One thing I really love is the battery life. I bought the phone 7 weeks ago, charged it once for 24 hours, and just did my first recharge a couple of days ago. Wow! 7 weeks of battery life! OK, I didn't use it too much, but it was turned on for at least part of every day during that period. My previous phone lasted about 3-4 days with that kind of use.OK, so are there any negative points? I must say, the ""manual"" is totally inadequate, and you are on your own to figure out how to do certain things. I had to Google like crazy, and eventually found a lot of tips in Amazon reviews, of all places. So, to continue the practice, here are a few things you might want to do with the phone:1. Turn it on: push and hold the red ""hangup button"" for 5 seconds2. Turn it off: same as above.3. Lock the keypad: Push the center of the big pad in the middle under the screen, then quickly press *. Same to unlock.4. Enter silent mode: push and hold #. Same to exit.5. Switch input methods while texting: press # to cycle through options. Choices are English (abc), Spanish (es), Portugese (pt), or numeric (123). NOTE THERE IS NO T9 PREDICTIVE TYPING ON THIS PHONE.6. Type a symbol while texting: Press *7. Turn off the annoying startup/shutdown music: Enter silent mode before turning off (took me forever to figure this one out).8. Turn of the flashlight: push and hold center of the big pad in the middle under the screen. Same to turn off.There's more, but that should get you started.So, overall a great phone that meets my needs. I'm very happy."

Negative,"From a non-tech savvy traveler. Bought for a friend to use in Campinas, Brasil. Works extremely well in that crazy environment. I put my own Sim card in the phone and worked it for two weeks prior to travel south. Nao problemas!!! Previous comments regarding batt life are true. If you game alot,.....better have your charger. Kid in their house put this phone through its paces. Still going strong after five months. Pictures are great,.....love the screen display. Audio is clear. Just recently I bought a gel cover from Alibaba.com. A previous reviewer (ColorMeBlue) mentioned the lack of accessories at Blu. True! (Come on Blu,...you can do it!!!) CMB recommended the Gionee GN 878 at Alibaba.com. Gave it a shot and it fits perfectly. Numerous colors to choose from as well.Three weeks delay due to China Postal but well worth it. ($7.00). Thanks CMB!"
Negative,i enjoy using this phone. it very lovely and perfect for everyone to use. trust me ppl shul give a try on this phone.
Negative,"I purchased this for international travel due to the dual sim card. I have a Samsung Galaxy S3 that does not have a SIM slot so I needed to find an unlocked phone I could plug international sim cards into. I researched the Blu models and chose this one because it was the only one I found with the super amoled screen. I am very happy with this phone! Legitimately, this phone is every bit as good as my Samsung Galaxy S3. Aesthetically, it does not look quite as nice until you take into account how vivid the display is. I tested this against my Samsung and it rendered web pages and You Tube videos faster. In my quick casual testing this phone is faster than the Galaxy.The only drawbacks are the contacts application, text application and phone dialer are a little more old school looking and plain than something like a Samsung but you get over that quickly, the charger plugging into the top of the phone and the power button being on the left side of the phone are a bit awkward as well. The battery does drain fairly quickly and is permanently fixed to the phone so cannot be removed and swapped out. With a fair amount of usage I would think it will have to be charged to make it through the day.Other than the few drawbacks ..this is truly a beautiful phone with the vivid display and is a very well made and quality phone and is an excellent value the $200 price point."
Negative,"I have received the phone and it really exceeded my expectations.I'm in Colombia and the goal was to have my voice plan with an operator (Claro) and data with the other (Tigo), for my voice operator and I just 2g and 3g for data and my first impressions are:From an intuitive way the phone is set to preset voice calls and messages on one line and the data on the other, so we will not be subject to choose sim whenever we make a trade.You have the option to choose between 2g and 3g networks, 2g to save battery and 3g when required to use stronger, version of android is very clean and without being charged with third-party applications such as computers, leaving many space for applications that wish to install, in terms of response speed and are excellent display with no problems so far.1.21 The dual core processor, the actual ram is 970.48 mb and has space in rom 1022.65 mg for applications, more than enough but if you want the copy on the sd, we have 1.92 GB available memory or the sd that we insert, in the particular case I have a 32 gb smoothly.Although the specifications say that the camera is 8 mp, 12 mp actually appears, but there is no option to change the resolution in the application predetermines whether third-party applications we can do.If it seems odd that the headphone jack is on the bottom but it is a matter of habit, I think the size and while it is lightweight plastic housing it seems sturdy.I used the hotspot option and it works perfect, the only thing is that it blocks incoming calls by voice line for some is good for others is wrong, it's a matter of taste.The battery life is very similar to other smartphones, turning it on at 6:30 am and with moderate use (chat, email, calls, etc ...) I got home at 7:00 pm and I have the 30% or 35%, and if used with video or something else runs faster.I was surprised FM radio sound is excellent and has the option to record broadcasts.The GPS works smoothly, I noticed even that is not lost both signal and other equipment and has met my requirements.So far I have not had problems with google play and applications, as other teams not very popular brands incompatibilities established, all I installed without problems.I tried to get accessories but are not options, especially silicone cases, but this case was http://www.amazon.com/Luxmo-Vertical-Leather-Holster-Carrying/dp/B008FQT28M and fits perfect.In short I think an excellent dual sim option, just as good as the big brands, it's more I decided that when it goes on sale the blu life, buy one to replace this.The Good:* Dual Sim option.* Good resolution camera.* Good response speed.* Android version very clean.* Excellent sound.* Low cost.The bad.* Block incoming calls when you can hotspot.* Low battery life (common to all smartphones).* Lack of third-party accessories or blu."
Negative,So I ben having this phone sense Friday and it's great for I see i really had to do my research on this phone got on YouTube like android authority phonedog and Flossy carter all those and a lot of customer reviews too I thought bout getting the xl but I like this better especially with the 32 memory but I think its a good choice and for 200 u realky cant beat it
Negative,"It's a great phone. Have used it for 3 days and it runs applications smooth.Just by holding the phone is feels great. Makes you feel like you have a high end to our these line smartphone, but then you realized you only payed $200 for it. And that's a better feeling.THE BAD.- DUAL SIM IS WEIRDThe slots fits a NANO & MICRO Sim Card, and a SD card. (it took me awhile to figure it out)- you can use a MICRO Sim and SD card at the same time.BUT you cannot use a NANO CARD and SD Card at the same time.So basically you cannot insert two Sim cards + SD CARD. It won't fit.That's my only complaint"
Negative,"The most amazing phone ever, sooooo nice, soooooooo elegant, worth 2-3 time more than they sell it for.i have my personal and my business SIM card in it, swiftly move from one to the other"
Negative,Screen okay but the digitizer underneath broke after 2 weeks
Negative,"Nice phone, I was really happy until screen light go down, on the right sides appears grey spots and, on all entire screen, grey lines. I return it to Amazon, hoping to get full refund as stated."
Negative,Excellent phone
Negative,"After 3 months be ready to trash it, battery refuse to charge, plugging over night stopped at 69.percent. am done with BLU never again!"
Negative,I bought this phone for my grandparents in the beginning of April. This phone checked all the boxes for them and I wanted to get them something that will be useful in their everyday life. At the end of May the phone broke. It simply boots to the Blu Vivo intro screen and then restarts and cycles like that for ours. Poor quality. Very disappointed. Never buying anything from this brand again.
Negative,Phone is ok but soft ware update is too bad keep lie to customer it was post upgrade to 6.0 software on Q2 but still not yet keep say working hardüòàüëÆ
Negative,"I like this phone even though it doesn't have all the bells and whistles. What I need a simple smart phone with a reasonable price. This is it. It has 3GB Ram and runs fast. The camera mega pixel is the same as Samsung Galaxy. The screen resolution is not as high, but the quality of the actual photos are important."
Negative,"The phone exceeded expectations. Many of the positive reviews are accurate. In short, I would by another."
Negative,Nice
Negative,This phone is bateer then any android phone pluse the very good price for such a perfect well made smart phone5 star
Negative,"Very good phone, it does everything Apple and Android phone does. Will recommend and buy again."
Negative,High quality
Negative,"Excellent relation price - quality. Fast, light and well assambled. I recommend it."
Negative,DO NOT buy this phone from AmazonGot phone with large crack down the middle of the screenOnly 4 weeks and the phone sound stopped workingphone barely charges it takes an extremely long time and then just dies
Negative,Good smartphone
Negative,I bought a phone for 200 & it came in & its used! And another thing it didnt say it was used. When it came in i turn the phone on and the screen stayed black it never turnes on but it was on cause i could hear the volume turn up but the phone never lit up. Not worth my money!
Negative,"All, this is not good product. I bought this and used properly. After 2 months it stopped working because of energy was not loaded to the phone. Master told me that 90 % of Blu phones are defect in charging joint and not possible to fix it. Thanks"
Negative,"This phone is great for what it is. The screen is gorgeous, surfing is fast, battery is a champ and charges fast. The three draw backsomething are the buttons on the bottom are backwards so that takes getting used to and the pictures it takes are juat okay and the speakers not super...not bad but not great. But a 200.00 it's great"
Negative,Yes.very happy
Negative,Why spend an arm n a leg for an iPhone while this VIVO 5 does the same n perhaps better.Buying for my mother in law as her birthday gift.
Negative,"The product was looking good. but Quality wise not that great. when we are using speaker, the microphone is getting disabled. not user friendly like Samsung or iPhone though they advertise like it is same. again it does not have any option keep the apps to home page and remaining apps separately. I got used phone which had more scratches though they said it is like brand new and 99% positive."
Negative,"Update:8/23/16-Had tge pgone in my back pocket sat down and splinter cracked the screen. The scteen protecter has kept it in tact and function not lost. Aweek later at work i dropped it in water, fully submersed! I immediately turned it off and left it to dry for an hour. Expecting the worst i powered on and everythings normal! That was a week ago! ........Original review-Great phone so far. Had a blu life one for a year before i cracked the screen. It still works but decided to upgrade. This is a solid feeling phone love the metal case. Fast, reliable good battery life. Usb is new style mimicking the lightning reversibility connection so the cord you get is one you can't lose. I haven't found a backup yet. I'm hooked on blu for the price and quality. I feel like i'm getting exactly what i pay for. 700$ for a tiny tablet? No thanks, ill get the phone with tablet features for 200$. Oh! You had to replace the iphone again?! Bummer. Not me."
Negative,"I purchased this cellphone 4 months ago and everything was perfectly working. However, suddenly it takes more than 24 hours to reach the 100% charge. I am using the original charger. I was reading another reviews and I think that my cellphone will be usefulness soon.I wanted to buy a Blu cellphone to my wife but now I would never buy this brand again."
Negative,"I ordered this phone for my husband. He previously had the Blu Life XL, and was looking for an upgrade. The Blu Vivo 5 is super slim, well-made, looks classy and works pretty fast. Takes great pictures too!!!"
Negative,Perfect
Negative,Great phone for the price. I dropped it and the screen stopped working so I had to buy a new one. And of course I loved it so much I bought a new one. I could have upgraded but I like the design of this one best.
Negative,This phone is definitely worth the cost. It's fast and feels good in the hand. It's the best of both worlds iPhone looks like with an Android brain. it looks expensive and people notice . Also very happy it plays Pokemon go (gyroscope!)
Negative,"I recently bought Blu XL for my brother and I used it for a couple of weeks, it was so great with the price, my brother told me he is happy with the camera quality, then after a while I bought this product Vivo 5 for my cousin, the worst camera ever , for $200 I would buy used iPhone and be happy with the camera than Vivo 5"
Negative,"First off, I'll never in the near future very anything but BLU. I don't know if I'm lucky or if they just have a great product for the price. The speed is the fastest they offered when I got this phone a few months back and it still gets the job done. Whether I'm gaming (but I don't do day games like need for speed), streaming, talking or anything else if gets the job done and looks good doing it. Why pay 800 to own a phone when you can save 75%or more for the better things in life. The only thing missing from this phone is a 240fps high speed camera for slow motion video (I like good footage when flying or shooting my guns) but only one phone has that and is still not worth it. Based on how I felt, this phone is better than the S4 and on part with the S6 that I once had... Again, most of my time spent recreationally on a phone is for streaming Motogp, YouTube or playing games. The camera is fine... I'm not a professional photographer"
Negative,"First of all, I am a Apple FanBoy. Secondly, I was skeptical somewhat of switching from iOS to Android OS, but I must say I am pleasantly surprised how easy it is to use also after you do some tweaking. As in use of Apps to better the Android experience, because in my past I have owned a HTC phablet & that was not a good and quick phone to respond to text or make a phone call which are the MAIN functions of owning a cell phone.I opened the box immediately & found a beautifully crafted smartphone inside. It felt sturdy and of great quality, all of which I had the same feelings about my iPhone 6. Next, I found that the screen protector was pre-installed on my VIVO 5, and was perfect from edge to edge. AWESOME!! Next I set up the device, installed my Pokemon Go game and tried it out immediately because I have a BLU VIVO AIR LTE I was using, & it lagged slot and the AR function never worked. But on this device, it was smooth, AR worked & it was smooth. AWESOME!!!Shortening my review now, this was an AWESOME buy and an AWESOME iPhone replacement!!!I won't be going back to an iPhone now due to this BLU VIVO 5!!! BEST 200 BUCKS I've ever spent!!DON'T HESITATE TO BUY THIS FOLKS! AWESOME DEVICE!! AWESOME PHONE. AWESOME SEMI-TABLET!!!BUY THIS!! U GUYS WONT REGRET IT!!!"
Negative,I have used this for only 2 month it was fine but after 2nd month screen started going freeze and battery takes ages to recharge.
Negative,Perfect
Negative,Phone is a piece of junk. I have had it less than a month and it will shut off on its own won't be able to turn it back on for hours then all of a sudden it will turn back on.It will also freeze.
Negative,Great
Negative,"Awesome phone with specs similar to galax s7 and can give it a run for it's money (wife has an s7 edge) don't have fingerprint scanner, Android pay chip, nor water proof. But I don't care about them things. Review is from my vivo 5"
Negative,"I purchased for my mother it is very good phone it has 13MP Main Camera,5MP Selfie Camera,3GB RAM."
Negative,Excellent phone best I had in years
Negative,it works perfect!!!
Negative,"I like this phone, I got it for good price, is fast works perfect in my phone company I am very happy with this product."
Negative,I absolutely think this is almost just as good as the galaxy s7...only big reason for me is the s7has 1 more gig of ram... My only complaint so far is that it goes on and off with reading my sim card but that could also be my carrier... I have metro PS with an unlimited 4glte plan which only makes this phone even more amazing because I can us as much LTE as I want... It's amazingly fast loads instantly and no glitches so far... Still trying to get used to 5.1lollipop so far but for $200...stop looking it not gonna find a better phone even if you have $400 to spend
Negative,"I purchased this phone about a month ago for my wife. She has a Samsung Note 3 a flagship phone from 2013, which is still running perfectly fine, but decided to get this for her to test the world of unlocked phones. A couple of years ago the mid range phone market was non existent, fast forward to 2016 the selection can be mind boggling.This review will be a comparison between the two phones and her experience. BTW my carrier is T-Mobile and coincidentally they have refurbished Note 3's for $199.Features/Specs/Performance:Both have fairly large screens. The Vivo 5 coming in at 5.5"" (720p) while the Note 3 at 5.7"" (1080p) super amoled. Looking at the screens side by side she says can't really tell the difference in sharpness, both screens are vivid and vibrant with color. However, I Vivo 5 does get a bit brighter. The Note 3 has a stylus, while the Vivo 5 doesn't.Both have 32GB of internal storage and 3GB of RAM, the Vivo has an 8 core Mediatek processor vs the Snapdragon 800.Both running Android Lollipop (Note 3 upgraded from KitKat) with their respective skins, I'm hoping BLU keeps it's promise of Marshmallow. My wife grew accustomed to Touchwiz, so I download Touchwhiz Apex Launcher from Google Play to keep her Android experience fairly the same.Camera: Both sport 13MP rear shooters, in good light both produce very nice images. I would give the edge to BLU because of the software and options for full manual control. The front facing camera on the Note 3 is 3MP while the Vivo 5 has a 5MP, both are just good at best.Performance: Both performed equally well, both are very fluid, smooth and no lags at all. Her daily tasks include...social media, phones calls, texts, Google Calendar, Cozi, Photo Editing apps, Web Browser and online shopping. She also dabbles with Video Editing with an app called KineMaster and both phones handle HD video with ease.In conclusion, today the market is saturated with a ton mid range unlocked phones and the BLU Vivo 5 is this one of them. It's aimed at users that do not need the top of the line specs and hardware but is still able to provide full functionality. Would I recommend this phone to that type of user? ABSOLUTELY!"
Negative,"I bought this phone because my Moto G 3rd generation started messing up once it updated to Marshmallow 6.0. There was no way I could downgrade to Lollipop, so I began searching for a new phone. Ive had Blu phones before and I love them. I just hate the low variety of phone cases. But anyways, this phone is amazing! My only issue I can say is I can't se all the new emojis due to it only being lollipop. But that's very minute. The camera is great, storage is great, and it runs smooth and fast. What shocked me the most is the camera. The back camera produces very quality professional photos. The front facing camera isn't bad either. Get in some good light and those pics look great as well! The design of the phone is so stylish. I just love it."
Negative,"Absolutely delighted with this phone! Camera quality is superb, screen resolution is fantastic. It's actually been dropped down the toilet and is still perfect, just took a couple days to get the moisture out of the camera lenses! The battery isn't as good as I thought it'd be, probably due to the screen but overall amazing phone for the price. Brought this phone back to Ireland, to buy something similar here would cost ‚Ç¨800/‚Ç¨900. This cost me ‚Ç¨177. And it's pretty too!"
Negative,Love it nice phone but only one problem with this phone and it is that this phone doesn't have a universal charger so I have to keep charger with me every time where ever I go ....
Negative,Very nice phone
Negative,"I have no complaints about this phone, had it for almost 2 months it works just fine"
Negative,"it is a fragile phone.my digitizer die after 2 month, with no sigh of screen crack or break. be careful with that. now it is a pieces of junk craft. no worth 200 Dallas. as i know if you try to fix it the digitizer cost 94 Dallas, not to mention the repair fee. buggy phone isn't save money, it actually cost me.don't buy, or goodluck with the same experience that you may get.downthe. road."
Negative,"Phone stopped working after 2months,won't even power on horrible product."
Negative,Decent battery life....have used it for a few months....seems tough enough to me. Decent amount of memory. Nice large screen.
Negative,Horrible
Negative,excelente
Negative,had it about a month..... no complaints as it seems to be exactly as they described and functions flawlessly
Negative,"So I've had the BLU Vivo 5 for almost a month and I have to say I'm very pleased with this device (or at least so far so good). Had an HTC Desire Eye before and it leaves it in the dust. I see BLU coming out with more great products in the future and putting the HTCs, Samsungs and Apples of the world on notice. An unlocked phone with this much speed (3GB of memory standard, great processor, and 32 GB standard HD) and build quality (Aluminum) for under $200...very nice."
Negative,This is a very good phone for the price
Negative,"The best phone I ever have, great camera"
Negative,cool
Negative,Very nice phone and thin. Love it !!!
Negative,Awesome phone!!!!! I love it!!!Price is great! Looks and feels like a high pricePhone but costs a lot less.
Negative,Price is great and this is the best phone i have ever had just got rid of my samsung galaxy s3 the blu vivo5 is fast everything is great quality but the only thing is the speaker on calls is a little quiet but high quality will stick to only blu products.
Negative,"Awesome smartphone in competitive price. Very friendly Android. That phone I bought for my 78 yo mom. She use very easy. Fast processor, big memory extended to 64 GB. She reading ebooks and watching broadcasting TV in internet. Very good product. Thank you"
Negative,I have always used unlocked phones since I have had a cell phone. I don't like contracts. Because of this I've always been stuck with either older phones or lower quality phones. I paid less for this phone than many of the other phones I've owned and it works much better and is cheaper than some. Screen is great! I don't notice the pixels like a lot of youtube reviews said I would and video quality is amazing. I love the speaker and the headphones that came with the phone. Also muti-tasking is smooth and fast. Since purchasing this phone I also got one for my wife and my mother.
Negative,Amazing! Value for money * 2
Negative,"This is one fine phone it's like a combination of Android and iPhone, works flawlessly. I would not trade it for any on the market."
Negative,This phone is horrible do not buy it it has connectivity issues anywhere ranging from your signal to the Bluetooth not working
Negative,I have the phone on tracfone.Working great so far.I only had the phone active for one day so far will update at a later timeas of now I love the phone
Negative,Well worth the price
Negative,Love it!!!!
Negative,Good reception and long battery life
Negative,just what i wanted
Negative,"I've had this phone now for about 3 months now and it is still going strong. I've dropped it several times and bumped it against things but the phone is still in great condition (minus some very faint scratches on the screen). It has not slowed down noticeably with multiple apps and hundreds of pictures and videos downloaded on the device. The screen looks very crisp for only being 720p HD. The processor and ram configuration runs very smoothly. I usually have about 20 internet pages and multiple apps open simultaneously with no studdering. I've owned Android smart phones since the Samsung Intercept and a dozen since. This is my first experience with Blu, but so far I have been very impressed. Now everyone in the family has one; the fiance and both girls. All for less than the price of one Galaxy or iPhone. Highly recommend this phone."
Negative,Great phone. Screen looks really good and battery life is great.
Negative,"This phone is really nice and loaded for $200. Pretty sure you cant do better for the price. The demand for this phone seems high, yet it is really hard to find a new one anywhere. Not sure why. If you can find one though, get it!"
Negative,Nice thing for the price
Negative,"You get a bang for your buck with this phone. The biggest highlight is the battery life. With heavy usage, I'm usually at 30% at the end of the day. The camera is okay under good lighting but subpar with low lighting. Nevertheless, I love this phone and I've recommended it to several of my friends."
Negative,"I did a lot of research on this phone and thought I would take a chance. I am so glad I did, this phone is terrific, I couldn't be happier..I have also got a lot of complements on it, I would and have recommended this phone to everyone."
Negative,I've had the same problem as other reviewers. Wish I'd seen those reviews before buying it. I've had the phone less than three months and already the battery is very slow to charge. It takes nearly 24 hours for the battery to get to 98-99%. It's not the power cord because I bought another one to try with same results. The phone has not been damaged in any way. This must be a problem with this model. I've had other Blu phones and never had a issue like this. So far I have not heard back from Blu or Amazon.
Negative,"Nothing but problems with this phone. #1, did not receive the phone I ordered. #2, the phone has over 15 voicemail messages that came with the phone??? #3 Even AT&T technician can't make the messaging portion of the phone operate. Has referred me to their advanced department. #4 the phone came with several messages on it already???Would not suggest that this is a product worth owning. I already returned two of these phones and have had it with this one."
Negative,This phone is the hands down the best 200 dollar phone ever.I would have paid 700 dollars fir it
Negative,I love it
Negative,This is great phone it has a nice design and feels good in the hand. I had not heard of Vivo before and wanted to see what they had to offer and I have been surprisingly surprise. The camera is the only drawback it is not really good it is even bad sometimes but overall a great phone. cant wait to see what they do for the Vivo 6
Negative,"I feel like this phone worth twice the price you actually pay!Screen is huge. It comes with its own screen protector and transparent cover.Besides, it is affordable!I bought 1 for myself and 1 for my wife. She really liked it!I would totally recommend it!Love it!"
Negative,"I received my new Blu Vivo 5 Smartphone 3 days ago and I could not be happier with it! The 4G lte is working perfectly for me since I have phone service that uses T-Mobile's lines. I immediately dialed a friend to check out the sound quality. My friend's voice was crystal clear and she assured me that I sounded great on her end as well. Although the 5.5 inch screen is gigantic compared to the size of my old Window's phone, my Vivo feels so light weight and easy to hold to the ear. I was concerned that such a large phone would feel awkward to hold but with how thin the phone is, it actually feels much more comfortable to hold.It took me a while to decide to go with the Vivo 5 since my other choice, the Blu Life One X, has the 1080x1920 screen resolution compared to the Vivo 5's 720x1920. However, the Super AMOLED display is very sharp and the colors are so vivid I can hardly resist picking it back up just to look at the gorgeous screen! Next, I had to try out the camara. Due to low light conditions, my first photo was less than satisfactory but I discovered a setting just for low lighting and tried again. Much sharper and the focusing wasn't even too bad either despite my hand tremor. I'll need to take more photos but already I can say that the colors came through a hundred times better than my last phone.I am no techie so trying to set up my phone in a way that I could avoid having to search for my favorite apps or phone contacts, I went searching for a new launcher. Before buying my new Vivo 5 android phone, I didn't even know what a launcher was for. The short message is: You must have a new launcher! There are so many great launchers out there that I had a hard time choosing and even watched Youtube videos to decide. I went with a fairly simple, Yahoo Aviate Launcher. I am so glad I did! On my home page I can swipe up for my favorite phone contacts to pop up. Having easy access to my family phone contacts is essential for me. Also, I can put as many of my favorite apps on the home page as I like. Swipe right and on my next screen Aviator has pre-sorted my apps into categories such as Social, Music, News, and more! Swipe to the left of the home page and I have news and info specifically chosen for where I am and the time of day. The Yahoo weather is right there for a quick look at radar.I am very picky about new purchases but this Vivo 5 phone has met my every expectation. The only slight complaint has been the phone case that came with the phone. Overall it does the job and will be fine until I can purchase a better lasting case but at first I had trouble plugging in my head phones. It seems that the hole in the case for the port was just a tad small. I switched over to my favorite ear buds that are less thick where the jack plugs in and it's working better for me. Oh, and the built in FM Radio Tuner is a pleasant surprise! You can only use it with the head phones plugged in since it works as the antennae but that's the only way I listen to music with my phone anyhow. The radio reception sounds great on the phone. Several times a day, I make a new discovery of features that I have been missing out on with using an outdated Windows phone. The 'Ok Google' feature is the coolest thing ever! I can tell Google to email my husband a grocery list or reminders without ever touching the keypad. Some of you who have not been deprived of fun Android apps may be snickering at me, but I am having the most fun with my new Blu Vivo 5!"
Negative,Revived mine yesterday and so far I love it the phone feels very snappy and fluid and the face unlock works better than expected the battery life is decent though I'm biased coming from a studio energy 2 I listen to a lot of music and the DTS sound is a nice touch the build quality is great and the phone is lighter than I expected and the gold is very eye catching I've had 4 other blu phones and this is my favorite so far
Negative,Fantastic phone. Value for money. Gorgeous design
Negative,"Best phone out there IMO, I love every and each features on this phone"
Negative,I like this phone much better than the Samsung Galaxy S5. The gold is a great eye catcher. It is easy to learn how to use without instructions.
Negative,Very good
Negative,Did a lot of research before I pull the trigger. Best decision I made. Best phone for the price!
Negative,DIDN'T WORK. I'M FROM ARGENTINA AND SELLER TOLD ME HE CAN'T DO ANYTHING. SO UPSET AND ANGRY
Negative,"It is very fast, no problem at all. I like it."
Negative,Excellent
Negative,"Really nice device.The build quality is very good and the phone is pretty responsive.Update after a few days use.The screen anti fingerprint coating is pretty good.I did install a different launcher (Nova) as I don't like the iphone style interface.The phone charges really fast as well. Call quality is good, but I did turn of the noise reduction in call settings."
Negative,The blue Vivo 5 for a mid range smart phone is a great product for someone who can not shell out 700.00 dollars for a flagship phone. Plus Blu has packed some great features for a phone of this price range I love this phone so far.
Negative,"I have lived with this phone for a month and a half and I am ready to review it by saying... you need to purchase this phone if you are looking for a lower cost full feature phone! I really love my BLU VIVO 5 phone! i went form a Nexus 5 to this BLU VIVO 5 and I have to say, I am incredibly happy with my decision! The phone looks and feels like a flagship phone at a fraction of the cost of today's flagship phones! The phone has 3gb of ram so there is no lag when opening or working in apps! The metal case feels awesome and my phone looks like a mission bucks for only a couple hundred bucks! It came with a clear case and screen protector. The rear camera is very good and there is no lag between taking pictures. I really love how nice my pictures come out! The processor is powerful enough to the point you forget you are on a phone! The android version 5.1 is not bad, I wish BLU would release 6.0 update however I like 5.1 and can live with it. BLU has added their own version of 5.1 so the one thing you will notice is no app drawer. I don't mind it because you can easily download a launcher or do what I did, created a folder of apps I don't use and drop them into that folder on my second home screen this way I see only the apps I used frequently. There are apps delivered with the VIVO 5 that are not needed, however there are actually some cool apps too! Again, the ones I don't need went right into the one folder on my second home screen! I am getting used to swiping up on the home screen to get to very useful quick settings! This is different than the phones I had previously. The battery holds its charge throughout the day and I love the quick charge feature! There have been times where I forgot to plug in the charger, and I needed a quick charge to be able to run errands and I can get almost a 25% - 30% charge increase in like 20 minutes! I love that! I am slowly moving my family to the BLU family of phones! Three of us are now using BLU phones and so far so good! The screen is awesome and I still can't believe it is so nice at this price point! I look forward to living with this phone and for the specs of this phone, it is such a great value!"
Negative,"Great Phone Great Price an Extra, look for a screen protector and sturdy case."
Negative,"Simply put, this phone is absolutely a STEAL for the price (even if it was $100 more!)*First impressions*Let me start by saying the build quality on this device is absolutely amazing. When I pulled this thing out of the box, I was SHOCKED at how nice this phone not only felt in the hand, but the way it was put together. With it's all aluminum body and rounded edges, it does feel a little like an iPhone, but much thinner (and dare I say) and a little nicer. (LESS SLIPPERY!)I was also blown away by the fact that this phone was only $200. Really? For this phone?The next thing that shocked me was what you got for that $200. Inside the box, Blu includes a 2amp quick charging plug, a USB TYPE-C CABLE (Yes!), a silicone case, headphones, AND a screen protector. You buy this, you have everything you need.*Performance and software*The phone features a Mediatek octa core processor with 3gb RAM, dual sim, and microSD expansion. It includes 32gb of onboard storage stock.After using it for a little while, I realized that this phone is quite snappy. Almost never have I had any lag or bugs on it. The software on it, while not for everyone, is actually quite fun to use and has a lot of cool features. I won't list them all, but one of my favorites is this app called ""chameleon"" where you use your camera to look at certain things, pick out 2 colors, and the phone will ""theme"" your homescreen with those said colors. Very cool indeed! The only ""Con"" I'd say for this device is that out of the box, the phone does not come with an app drawer. For people use to most Android devices, that may be a con or something you'd need getting use to. For an iPhone user, it feels very similar. However, don't let this discourage you, as you can download a third-party launcher with an app drawer in the store. (I recommend Google Play Launcher to start with).Overall, fantastically snappy, RAM management is good, no bugs that I noticed, and performance is great for it's price. (even rivaling some high-end phones I've owned!)*Screen*The screen is a 5.5 inch 720x1280 Super Amoled screen with Corning Gorilla Glass 3. I will admit, before I saw the phone in person, I was a little worried about it's resolution. I am coming from phones with 2k screens, 1080p screens, and the last 720p screen phone I had was 4.7 inches (which was fine). However, when I saw this screen, it completely shattered my expectations. The screen itself is vibrant, colorful, large, and has great viewing angles. While using the phone for a while, I noticed the resolution didn't bother me AT ALL. The screen quality itself is just too good for it to matter at this price point. Sure, 1080p looks great. But when comparing another phone in this price range with a 1080p LCD screen and this, I'd take this ANY day of the week. If you're worried, don't be. Watch videos, scroll through social media, etc. You won't be disappointed. Also, BLU includes software that lets you change the screen's tone a little bit. Changing from Cool, Warm, to Neutral (default setting).*Camera*I've heard that phones usually in this price point DO NOT have great cameras. However, this camera is again, more than you'd expect. While in low lighting it's not the greatest, it actually shines very well in good lighting situations. If you use this phone outside during the day (when most people take pictures) you'll have a wonderful time with it. The 13 megapixel f2.0 aperture lens is great at picking up not only light, but details. I was actually quite pleased with it's performance. Looking at pictures on this device is also great due to it's screen. On computer screens, you'll enjoy the details and colors on the pictures you take. It's great. The front camera isn't too shabby either. It's 5mp, and takes decent shots indoors but outdoors it's also quite good. Selfie game strong? You'll enjoy it! For both the front and the back cameras, BLU includes many different modes and settings for you to mess with including beauty, HDR, GIF, Professional (back camera), and more. Video quality is also great on the rear camera if you use the ""anti shake"" feature. It uses digital stabilization (no OIS) so it's not the most stable, but it actually does a decent job at it. Audio pickup is pretty good, too.*Battery life*This one will be short, because there isn't much to say. The battery life is FANTASTIC. With that amoled screen at a lower resolution, a 3150mah battery, and a power sipping processor, this phone will easily get you through a whole day of use. The first day I owned this phone, the battery not only lasted me all day, but 3/4 of the NEXT day. That being said, I wasn't using it crazy on the second day, but the fact that it lasted all night was something else. The standby time on this phone is also great.*Conclusion*So, should you get this phone? YES! If you're looking for a ""cheaper"" unlocked GSM smartphone, and don't want to compromise much, this is definitely a win. Even if you own a higher end Samsung, LG, Sony, Apple, etc and need a backup device, you can't go wrong here. The performance, camera, and overall quality is great for this price point. The build quality is honestly on par with devices 3x it's price. BLU has done a fine job with this phone, and I am very happy with this device. I know if you purchase this phone, you probably will be too!Cheers!"
Negative,Great solid phone!
Negative,Good product
Negative,Much better the i expected
Negative,One of the best phones I have ever had.... If not THE best
Negative,"Even with the good reviews I was pleasantly surprised when I got this new Blu phone. I previously owned a Blu phone last year and was not very impressed with the build quality and performance. This phone is s world of a difference! Build quality is excellent and fit and finish is outstanding. 3 GB of RAM, expandable storage, and a decent 13megapixel shooter make this phone worth the price! I was worried about the ""low"" res screen display, but i was wrong. It is 720 HD and is very nice to look at, even better than my last 1080 led displayed phone. Buy this phone, you won't be sorry. I will never buy a phone that cost more than $200 again!"
Negative,Screen died after one week of use. I could put up with the flickering but thos was too much. Returning immediately.
Negative,I'm very happy with my new phone. It has everything I need. Super fast and simple to use.
Negative,Awesome phone. Bought this for my 23 year old daughter. She loves it.
Negative,Love my BLU smartfone!....Second one from this company and highly recommend it....
Negative,Half price for that quality..Great phone.
Negative,Screen shatered without a touch
Negative,"The Best phone i ever had, super fast and multi tasking without problem. My only concern is the cover, i haven't found a very good one yet. This phone is amazing, the only little thing i have notice is the resolution of the display that in my case, having before a BLU Life Pure with all that resolution (1080 x 1920) in a 5"" inches device vs. this one with (720 x 1280) but is a bright and clear display that show all my gaming and videos very well, but i notice the diference, maybe others not."
Negative,Excellent!
Negative,AAA+++
Negative,Very nice and low budget
Negative,To be honest it's bigger than I thought but I love it. I'm using it to type now...
Negative,They are available as of Today Best buy has them now for ordering amazon just hasn't updated yet. Even though I have the Blu Pure XL I am getting one of these too. Blu makes great phones for decent prices.
Negative,Product and service were both excellent!
Negative,"IN YOUR FACE (APPLE / SAMSUNG / Etc)Let me just start by saying that Ive been an Android deboted fan since the G1, I can tell you that this is the most beautiful, slick and software refined androide device i've ever had (14 so far). The Body and build of this device is astonishing nice. You can tell that BLU spent their time tailoring the android OS to what they wanted to. Many interesting applications that the developer offers.I am still testing battery life but so far it is more than decent. The Super Amoled screen makes up for the 720p resolution which you can really notice and on the same page this lower resolution helps immensely witht he battery. call quality has been solid so far. I connected it to MetroPCS down in Miami and 4G LTE was picked on the spot, signal strength let me watch youtube videos on 720P60FPS( This may vary from area to area but if you are in south Florida you are set.) WIFI comes with the 2.4Mhz radio only it is trully a shame but not a biggie for me. This is an amazing phone ppl dont get it wrong, the time where BLU was only a cheap wanna be brand are over this here it is a real contender and for $200, trust me you won't believe the type of premium quality you are getting."
Negative,"I looked at numerous phone reviews on YouTube and Amazon and found this phone to out perform others with half the cost. First off, the phone arrived in two business days. Right out of the box, it set itself up, updated the software and worked perfectly. The screen is large with vibrant colors. If your an Android user, you'll be right at home. The phone feels like an iPhone 6 and works as good as a Samsung 7. The only thing that it doesn't have like the flagship phones have is a voice control, but I'm sure there's an app for that. I would highly recommend this phone for anyone who isn't a name brand snob."
Negative,Excelente
Negative,"Slender and sleek , shape as good if not better than iphone. great feel in hand and light to."
Negative,Excelent quality. Great display. It has almost every flagship feature but in a 200buks phone. The aluminium body feels really like an expensive phone. Is really fast toh.
Negative,"In short, I love this phone. I bought and use this phone for international travel. For the price, this phone is an incredible value: great performance, excellent/solid build quality, international GSM/LTE band support, dual SIM, expandable memory, etc... On top of that, BLU's customer service has been great. I had an issue with the external speakers, and BLU resolved the issue quickly, and way earlier than the quoted 15-20 business day turnaround. I'd definitely buy from BLU again"
Negative,"Awesome solid phone, screen is nice, I changed the launcher to Google now launcher the instant I got it, to give it a stock feeling and the battery life is awesome"
Negative,"I absolutely love this device. It's really thin, light weight and attractive. It's gorilla glass screen is really responsive and a great size...big...but still comfortable in your hand. The full metal body feels really solid. Again, I'm very impressed with how light weight it is. The silicone case that comes with it is really sleek so it doesn't make the phone bulky at all. It really does live up to all the hype on the video. I had not been impressed with my prior phone purchase. So, I am thrilled that this device totally exceeds my expectations. The phone sound is great and the 4G is pretty solid too. I am amazed I was able to get such a great phone for reasonable price. I am now a big fan of Blu."
Negative,Updated to 6.0.. completely useless now..save your money
Negative,Very impress by this piece of equipment. I have been a diehard Samsung Galaxy user for the last 4 years. I needed a new phone with a bigger screen from my S6 but couldn't justify spending $800 on a Note 7 or $500 on a used Note 5. So far I am beyond happy with my choice in purchasing the Vivo 5. I would highly recommend this phone to anyone looking for something like the Note.
Negative,This phone is not worth the money it lacks LTE channels it's reception sucks I'm now looking for a good phone.
Negative,Complete in fuctions and features. Very nice phone with a giod performance!
Negative,"Great quality phone for the price!! It arrived on time (2 day delivery) it came with all the accessories I need for it. The screen is huge and extremely high def. I'm glad I purchased this phone so much my husband also bought one as well bc its such a great buy. The only thing I dislike is the charger port, it takes a special BLU charger so try not to ruin the charger it came with is my advise lol.Update: had to throw it away!! I've had it about 6 months you get what you pay for! It completely spazzed out of nowhere. Stopped charging I even purchased 3 new chargers for it. So black screen nothing would happen would not charge now I'm out a phone and will NEVER buy BLU again"
Negative,Awesome phone for the price. Beats my iPhone 6 in everything except for the cameras.
Negative,"Better then the Nexus 5x (and I own both)...Honest review paid for by me on both phones let me start..LooksVivo 5 wins hands downScreen Nexus 5x ... that's not to say the screen is bad on the Vivo it's really good. Can only tell it's not as good when you hold it side by side with both on.ResponsivenessVivo 5 . That extra gig of ram and the mediatek processor really shine here compared to the snapdragon 808 and 2gb on the nexus.SoundVivo 5 again. Bass isn't quite as good as the 5x but clarity is much better as are the highs and midsCall QualityI am a u.s. person living in europe the gsm bands are close on both phones but the actual PRL's for my area are better on the vivo. Calls made to the U.S. and my wife here in Europe were the same as in no one could tell on either end what phone was what.Battery LifeVivo again. It's not just the battery size though . Everything about this phone on paper is less a battery hog then the 5x. Rooted, with every tweak I can think and turning off gps and anything else i can of I was lucky to get 5 1/2 hours of Screen on time (SOT after this) on the 5x. The Vivo does not have doze yet (it's coming) or the newest version of android and yet I can easily get 6 hours of SOT without babying it at all. Everything on full throttle baby! I love it. (Pro tip on battery life for any phone or tablet ... uninstall Chrome or any Chromium based browser and go Firefox. You will have the same features, and speed and also gain a noticeable bit of extra battery life. That, and uninstalling facebook and just using the browser to access will gain you an extra 40mins of battery life a day or more I promise you )Long story short...If you want to spend less then $400 for a phone that blows away the competition hands down this is better then the LG 5x or the Asus zenfone 2 I have owned all three and gave the 5x to replace the zenfone for the Mrs. while I kept the Blu."
Negative,good
Negative,"Best phone I have had so far, great performance I am very pleased with this purchase. Also great battery life , battery seems to charge very quickly when using the correct charger about 30 min on average from 35% level. I have ran multiple emulators and am quite impressed with the performance. Dropped this phone once and can not see any damage what so ever so the build quality seems to be great. Only a small complaint , I ordered the silver model but the actual phone is two tones white on the front and silver on the back. Looks like an I phone from the front view. I also purchased the BLU VIVO XL and am really happy with this phone as well."
Negative,"Excellent phone, I am very pleased with the purchase, very fast, enough battery, bright screen, very thin, and made with reward materials, feels great in the hand, fast charging, headphones are spectacular, very good sound, true if you want a phone that meets your expectations and do not want to spend on an iPhone a Samsung or any other high-end cell, this is the phone you wanted, really will not regret."
Negative,Like
Negative,"Great phone for the money, hell great phone period! Would give it a full 5 stars, but the first phone I received was defective right out of the box. Ive had the replacement for a few months now and Im impressed. Its a quality smart phone, well put together.UPDATE!! Not one day after I wrote this suddenly the speaker for the headset stopped working and now the only way I can answer or make a call is on external speaker mode or through Bluetooth.Will now have to send another Vivo 5 back for repair since its already past 30 days and can't just return it back to Amazon . I can no longer recommend it.Also Blu service has been less than stellar, as of this moment I still have not been sent return instructions.UPDATE TO THE UPDATEI did finally hear from blu a couple of day ago, but it was the same spill they already gave me asking for proof of purchase and the other same stuff they already asked and I provided with my first contact with them..... And my second.BUT Thank God I'm a prime member!!!I contacted amazon about my dilima with Blu and immediately another itinerary was ordered for me.Granted BLU vivo5 is on back order which is very inconvenient, but thats not Amazons doing and nice again Amazon goes above and beyond to make their loyal customers like myself happy!!Still be ware of BLU and their lack of customer service, but if you're going to buy a BLU product, make sure it's handled by Amazon!!"
Negative,Good product
Negative,This stopped charging after 2 days. I am unable to return as i live in the Caribbean. It is going to cost me 2 time the amount i paid for the phone to ship it back.
Negative,Very cheap useless phone.
Negative,"This phone is a piece of S@&$ Do not buy it by any reason! I bought this phone and first It became to restart without explanation 3 month after I got it. Then, after warranty fixed the problem the microphone doesn't works...... Ahhh by the way, Blu is locate in Miami (two block from my office) and I had to pay for a delivery because they don't receive the phone direct by customer. Now, I have to discuss again the problem, also I should pay again for delivery to fix the problem..... In conclusion, the phone just works the first two month and I have 6 month with the phone. Are you still want to buy it? DO NOT BUY IT"
Negative,"Nice phone...., but Blu's Customer Service is a nightmare! I had my Smartphone for two months and suddenly the hatch door jammed preventing me, as well as a Service tech in my area to get it to open to temporarily remove the Sim and SD card. No sympathy or customer service satisfaction given from Blu (even with a warranty included). No more Blu products for me of any kind from a business that keeps you on hold forever and who do not stand behind their products..., I'm through with Blu, for good!"
Negative,Best phone I've owned so far. Really well done in all aspects. New charge port is convenient. Design and performance have been top notch for six months now. I've dropped this several times (on the sidewalk) and have not had any serious damage (yet). This phone has really impressed me. Battery still lasts all day and haven't had any issues with bugs.
Negative,"Good afternoon, since I bought the phone its behavior has been slow and when I unload in the app that I use the system is stopped. I would like to communicate with you to change the equipment or to review it. Thank you"
Negative,"this phone is a rubbish phone. I only wasted my $200 for nothing. it doesn't charge at all even with the type C USB mouth. it took more than 48hrs to charge to 100%. I sent it back to the BLU company after 3 weeks of purchasing here. they claim to repair it unfortunately it doesn't. the most painful thing is that while at keep it in a safe place without using it, the battery drops down drastically. I am so piss off with this stupid device. I can't imagine keeping the phone charging without using it, and it can't charge to 100% for 24hrs. To be honest with people that tends to buy this phone, plssss spend your money on another phone. except if you want to end up like me. Plssss don't waste your money and be frustrated like me. the rating is 0 of 100."
Negative,"Bought phone April 30, screen went completely black. tried to hard reset it nothing will show up on the screen. 11/11. Phone didn't even last 6 months."
Negative,"After few weeks of use phone broke down, battery wasn't charging all the way, screen was freezing and several app wouldn't work. I also have some other issues that I couldn't get help solving, neither my cell phone provider or blu customer service would help me. Frustrating experience."
Negative,Best phone I've ever bought...no freezing...excellent gaming and graphics
Negative,"Love it!!! Pictures are clear and crisp! Very light in weight, but feels good in hand."
Negative,"Phone isn't even a year old and now it stopped charging. I bought the phone for my mom and she complained about how hard it is to use the phone every week until today when it stopped powering on. Apparently this is a big issue for BLU. Wish I knew, would have bought her an honor 5x like mine. Do not buy, Go Honor!!!"
Negative,"Loved the phone at first, but then the other day it stopped working. I cannot get it to even turn on and am having issues trying to get customer service to help me out. I'm not sure what my next step is. I like the phone I just it fixed or replaced."
Negative,Great Phone and cheap
Negative,"After reading the reviews, I decided to step up my phone game and get this guy. It's fast, has a lot of storage, calls sound good... for the price, I'd totally recommend it. (Stepping up from a long line of mediocre budget phones.)The only drawback is the charging port. It's a Blu-specific thing and I'm kind of waiting to lose the charger... I'll probably order a second charger after I write this actually."
Negative,"I never has an Android phone and was pretty much horrified to switch from my iPhone... Well, I will never go back to iPhone or any other phone for that matter. Blu Vivo5 had the most beautiful packaging and it's an incredible phone all around. I am using it now for a few months and have not had one issue, it's super fast and of an excellent quality... all that for 200$. Very happy customer, thank you. :)"
Negative,Phone only lasted 2 months before it bent at the volume rocker.
Negative,"One I had did not work. It would not allow me to answer calls, download pictures from texts. I would not recommend."
Positive,"Everyone wants my phone, its nice and so far it does what I want. I have my phone on straight talk, at first it was hard to get it transferred, but you have to talk to someone who knows what they are doing. So I did, and now I am taking care of business with my big phone and watching movies, while I wait at the Doctor's office. I love my phone, glad I got it. Don't want to go smaller either. Deb"
Positive,I am happy so far with the phone.got it on time..was locked but got it unlocked locally..so far it is working well
Positive,When I purchased the phome it said In ok condition but the phone looks brand new to me and I also recieved it a day befoew I expected... I love my phone...
Positive,"I have been thoroughly satisfied withe this phone since I purchased it. I was very skeptical at first before purchase, but I have not been disappointed."
Positive,oh my god I love my phone its perfect its beautiful and works great its fast internet is fast the calling doesn't drops anymore and it works with my t mobile 4GI will recommend to everyone
Positive,Its a used phone in perfect conditions works like it was new the best investment that I have made on a phone
Positive,this is a great phone i love everything about it. never had any problems with it thanks again i will buy soon
Positive,BEWARE its not new!!! Watchout i bought mine took it straight to atnt to get my phone turned on.the prone in sim card broken.atnt told me they sell brought back items from atnt stores.i was so upset just spent $370 for atnt note plus activation.i cried im single mom n i worked hard for that.. There avoiding m calls. Very had. upset.i ba dly
Positive,With the very nice price discount this device was an upgrade from the $240.00 phone I was sold on. I have to thank my girlfriend for stating she likes the Note series.
Positive,My phone is just a little over 6 months old and i have had repeated problems with it charging and holding a charge. I have tried different chargers to no avail. Overnight it went from a charge of 69% to 18% and now it won't charge at all when i am just getting ready to leave on a business trip. I would expect more from a $300 phone than a warranty of 30 days with something so basic as charging and holding a charge.
Positive,"This has amazing features, and a big screen. I used to have a apple product and It didn't have a stylus so I was unable to use it in the cold due to my gloves. This one comes with a stylus which is a big pro in my case. Breed shipped on time and they communicated with me so that I never worried that it would not arrive."
Positive,"This is an awesome phone! It has wverything I ws looking for and more. The screen is huge, while still being light and convenient. I'll never get around to using all the cool features, thrre are just so many! The seller is awesome to work with too!"
Positive,This phone came packed in its orginal packaging! (Used of course) And it was super easy to set up on the family mobile plan! I would reccomend buying this hone to anyone! Love it!
Positive,"after using this phone for awhile it is amazing i love the size , I thought it would be a little big but it fits really nice in my hands , nice and fast just wish they would give the jelly bean update , amazing phone i love it"
Positive,"LOVED THE PHONE, WORKED GREAT AND I COULDN'T HAVE BOUGHT IT FROM A BETTER PERSON. dEALING WITH aLEX WAS GREAT. IF I COULD I WOULD HAVE GIVEN THIS EXPERIANCE A 10."
Positive,"This phone would've been wonderful if my plan would've just changed to this phone. I cannot send or receive mms. If you want to be able to send and receive mms, don't get this phone. I wouldn't recommended this p.o.s. to anyone."
Positive,"I received the phone rather quickly. I'm quite impressed by the condition of the phone after being used. I wasn't sure if I would enjoy the larger screen, but now I wouldn't go back. I bought this phone to put on straight talk and thought I would have conflict finding a sim card, but I actually didn't. The phone takes the regular sim that they send so no need to worry. Plus the service is great, and the phone runs rather fast. I wouldn't trade it."
Positive,best xmas gift ever says my daughter.not one complaint these guys were the best to work with even when i messed up.thanks
Positive,"Mac Daddy phone, the telephone is ringing just like the song! great service and delivery as promised on time for our sons christmas because that's all he wanted for christmas did'nt you know Ho!Ho!Ho! very prompt and perfect service the Samsung came exactly as describe so no hidden dissapointments here! a big Thank-you to your company for fulfilling our order at such a hectic time of year, great great service and friendly too treated us like a real person not just a $$$ sign thank you keep on giving us the consumer deals and we will be there for you CHEERS!"
Positive,Gave as a gift. User loves it!
Positive,locked upwon't chargewaste
Positive,Excel√±ent
Positive,got wrong merchandise.
Positive,Just purchased this phone for my husband. Went to Wal-Mart to purchase straight talk at&t compatible SIM card for it.Thought it would be faster & better than his Samsung galaxy 3 but it's not; trying to make phone calls & search the web takes about 5 minutes. It lagged terribly. Paid $229 for this & we are very disappointed. DO NOT BUY THIS! WASTE OF $229 when we could of gone up to Wal-Mart & purchase the phone.
Positive,excellent
Positive,Freezed first week
Positive,It was not like new. It was used and I hat a lot of problems to activate the sim card in Germany.
Positive,I hate this phone I make a big mistake to buy 2 of this phone it's the worst phone I ever buy my bad luck is the day after I go it one of the phone felt down and the screen break down. Very easily break is unbelievable. I just have 3 month and im not and not going to be happy ever with this junk.
Positive,My experience was caotic the phone dont work just stay on for 2minuts and there off again and again dont buy this item. Sorry for mi english but im from venezuelan and this people aproche this situacion for gain money
Positive,i love it my new cell...
Positive,I love this phone

Positive,Didn't even last a full year....
Positive,thank you
Positive,"Wife loves this unit and still uses it, won't replace it with newer models in spite of my offer."
Positive,So slow I returned it almost immediatley
Positive,excellent
Positive,Works well
Positive,The phone only worked one month and the system crashed.
Positive,"I got this phone jan 2014. It is an old version of the note but this phone is way better than any other I have ever had. The screen is amazing and humongous making youtube, surfing and netflixing awesome. Just keep your charger with you. The things you love to do on your cellphone, especially this one, will drain the battery. I purchased a trident case for it. I just drop the phone for fun now. The case is awesome too!!!!!"
Positive,"My new phone is amazing. Its not the newest model but so what. It works great. I even gave my daughter my Samsung tablet now because the phone pretty much does everything I need it to. The battery last for the bay but its because i have too many applications running. Great buy indeed.Crisp clear screen , Excellent camera and I'm a photographer."
Positive,I bought beauty of a phone for my daughter and she loves it...I'm thinking of getting one for myself....This phone is incredible...it's a little big but looks really nice.It has everything that she wanted and works very well...
Positive,"Returned first order as it had a defective mini-usb connector. Ordered from the same company again as the defective mini-usb connector is a known issue with pre-Samsung Galaxy S5's and overall has been an android problem. So what I did was order the wireless charger from ECO Sound Engineering. I ordered the QI Universal Charging receiver and the charging base. I used the receiver tape and attached the receiver to the back of the phone and plugged that into the micro-usb connector. Then I placed my new rubber phone case over the back of the receiver and the phone. I placed the phone on the charging base and voila, it charges merely by just sitting the phone on it! Now, no more continually plugging a usb cord into the phone which causes these micro-usb connectors to go bad. Now, I'm extremely happy and the phone for the price is kick ass."
Positive,"I LOVE this phone! It's attractive, works great and has a fabulous display! The first one I got did work after 2 weeks, so I have to get another. This one is perfect! I would highly recommend this phone!"
Positive,Exelent
Positive,Nice phone. I just wanted a larger phone. Nothing wrong with the phone. Decent price. The company is wonderful. Treated me good and very fair. I recommend anyone to buy from this company.
Positive,Excellent ph loving it
Positive,I wouldn't even give one star but its makein me they marked my order shipped an left the facility a week before so I was expecting something that hadnt even left yet! When I recieved it the screen was cracked I decided to let it go an order one of of ebay because of te lack of comunication on the shipping and when I received it it took 4 full days to charge completly an now it will not charge at all the apps and internet ok everything on this phone takes 5 min to come up on the screen and this was supposed to b a great condition perfect working phone very very dissatisfied I have contacted them and am waitin for a response if they don't do something I am goin to extremely pissed!! As I paid 196.00 for this phone I expect to recieve what I pay for as stated in the description! !! WILL NEVER EVER ORDER FROM THIS COMPANY AGAIN AND IF U DO PLZ B CAREFUL
Positive,Excellent
Positive,"Got this from Cell Lounge. First one had scratches on screen. After countless emails and 1 month with Cell Lounge support, finally got replacement, and gave it as a gift. SIM card slot is faulty on the replacement unit, and unit is still with Samsung service center.Never ever buy from Cell Lounge."
Positive,so far this is the best phone that i have ordered without giving me any problems. where can i buy extra batteries and headset for this phone
Positive,"This phine i didnt use this yet i still waiting my sim,but how the look im sure i gonna love it,"
Positive,my bank says the money was debited and sent me a message that was rejected sales as we do?? j
Positive,I will recommended this phone to everybody....this phone is incredible useful and I love it.....heavy but very nice I will recommended to all customers
Positive,"I am not sure if this is the problem with the one i bought or with this model itself. it has some very obvious issues1. The phone is very slow.2. the signal points always show 2 points, while other mobiles show full signal for the same sim in the same location.3. Every click or touch takes a bit of time to respond, which is very annoying.i dont think i will trust this phone again. returning the phone second time.."
Positive,"This product was shown to be defective after very careful use of less than a year. It also was found to be not NEW, and that is what I ordered and what the invoice and receipt says."
Positive,i returned this because it would not read any of the sims i tried .. ..
Positive,This is the second one of this item i have purchased on amazon the first one the sim card would not register in the phone now i am disappointed that this one will not charge. I font advise anyone to spend money on this product that will give you nothing but problems. This is q poor product sold here on amazon and i am appalled and dismayed that i have had this issue occur again.
Positive,Outstanding
Positive,The phone never worked properly. It clicks off and I'm not able to text
Positive,Extremely disappointed. The product was not an original Samsung Note and it was an earlier version than the one advertised.
Positive,"So abad:1.- The phone is not unlocked.2.- I bougth a color blu, but the phone is black....:-("
Positive,excellent
Positive,"I was extremely pleased to find this phone at such a reasonable price. The item I received was in great condition - no scratches on the screen, no chips on the body. I received it quickly. I used it for USCC, if you know anything about USCC - it's almost impossible to use another phone that wasn't manufactured expressly for them. I used this to replace another android phone that I had dropped in the lake. I really wanted a nice large screen and the stylus really appealed to me. I was very happy with both features. As for the phone being a refurb/used phone - I had no problems whatso ever. I'd buy from this company again."
Positive,nice
Positive,"Probably one of the best phones ever made, a bit outdated since Samsung has the Note II and Note II out now, but still a very sophisticated phone. Works well and has alot of advance features. For the price you cant go wrong."
Positive,It was not unlocked I had to get it unlocked myself .. took it to 5 different shops but nun of them could unlock it. They kept saying it was a black imei in other words it was stolen. If it was up to me I would give it ZERO stars
Positive,"I love it!!! It was on time, great condition, it work great, I just popped my card in and went!!!"
Positive,"...there was a phone that was wonderful. It had many features, functions, and fruits of labor.It is a big phone. So think twice about how you will carry it around with you.I have been poking about with this phone since I got it yesterday, and it has so many things to learn that I will take a long time before I figure out all of it. From what I have seen, there is a lot customization allowed along with a lot of pre-loaded apps. Example: The memo app is very nice for it to allow stylus writing, text writing, attachment insertion, voice writing/recording, ability to share it, etc...The connectivity of the phone is also very strong. It seems a bit slow with hotmail for some reason, but everything else runs fast involving the net (4G / Wifi home speed).The camera captures great detail. Dual camera is a nice option. I have yet to test it for video calls.It has a fast-charging, removable battery. The charge seems to last quite a while (I keep power saving features on such as screen turning off after a minute.). There are many options to optimize your battery life when it is idle or to make sure your phone functions are not disabled if you want them to remain connected.The phone allows for expandable storage which is essential, in my opinion. There seems to be an option to transfer apps from the phone to the microSD card as well.The product for the price is great. If you have time, the Galaxy Note 2 might drop a bit more in price. But at the current time, it just costs too much when the Galaxy Note 1 (this product) is a nice thing for everyone to have. Tablet + Phone = Excellent idea."
Positive,"I have an iPhone 3G, but when I saw the Note in Walmart, I had to have it. I fell for the size and wanted it unlocked. I couldn't believe I found the phone here for a lot less than Walmart. I'm happy."
Positive,"I've had the phone for about two weeks and love it. However, I barely get a days use out of it before having to recharge. I check email, occasional navigation,facebook, text message. No games or videos or long hours on the phone. I am researching how to best optimize it's use (closing applications, etc) to extend battery life. I have found everything from turning off the data usage option to factory reset and OS upgrade as a solution. I'm not ready to do the latter. I love the phone so much I am considering just buying and carrying a couple of other batteries if optimizing the use does not work"
Positive,"The phone works great with Tmobile, but I had to update it to Jelly Bean to get it to work on 4g. It was pretty simple, just google directions."
Positive,I love it ad I would change it for anything else. I have t mobile and it working okay. I have onequestion is my phone running on tmobile internet or att
Positive,I love my new Galaxy Note with the 5.3 inch screen. It works well in all areas I do suggest using an extended battery. I bought my note brand new and was less then what I paid for my Galaxy S II
Positive,"Chose this rating for two major reasons: The phone perfectly met my desired requirement as well as serving the purpose for which it was bought.The seller's customer service department was very willing and able to answer all my questions at the time I needed them. Exellent service.Effective merchadise. Very sertisfied,"
Positive,"I carry my professional references books in the phone so I have them handy during work. The big screen makes it very easy to read. It's not a phone that would fit in your pocket. It takes good quality pictures and the focus is even better than a regular camera for close-up pictures. One downside is that the battery is barely enough for one day of use, so you should keep a charger handy."
Positive,My phone showed up in 2 days..yayyy...easy to use after setting up my way. Just wonder where is the 16 gb noted in specs..total available after factoring in apps etc is only approx 14gb..?? The Power button is in the wrong place. It would have been better if placed at the top instead of at the side...opposite the volume control button. The battery is a challenge and drains quickly especially when connected to the net..otherwise..great device!!
Positive,"works great, had phone for about a month now, unlocked and ready to be used, works with straight talk as well, needless to say my gf was happy."
Positive,love it ...i have had no issues so far...came on time and was in perfect condition...would not trade it for the world..
Positive,The phone does not work on any network it says network unavailable I can't figure out what's wrong with it I spent 300 for nothing just a waste of money
Positive,"Because of extensive traveling, I find the unlocked version a must. A little more expensive but worth the extra cost. I would highly recommend this phone to my friends."
Positive,My sons father loves the phone he very satisfied thwnk you ms.rosa that's I love shopping on amazon so convince
Positive,"I would like to give asaving co. a zero star but since I like to phone I give ""1"" or Uno. Post as a brand new online however when I received it as used product and damaged. Waste my time and effort. Hopefully, they need to do honesty business next time. Poor poor."
Positive,I simply love my note! I love to draw and this is perfect for it! the S Pen is what makes buy it. sorry for my English
Positive,"Very good phone, no regret. I had to purchased another one for my husband. I will recommend it because it deserves it price."
Positive,This is a excellent product it has all you need for surfing the net taking pics and listening to your tunes.This products is flawless and works great.If you won't a fast big screen handset i will recommend you look at this item.This does run 4g service if you have a gsm provider that offers that service to you and it is unlocked.
Positive,it was pretty good!it just has very few scratch on the side but i can not see it if i put the case on it.!!:)
Positive,Great
Positive,"I bought this phone and after a month, it stopped working, it was just like a waste of money cos i had to buy another phone. Unfortunately i can't return it. Waste of money, worst phone from this seller."
Positive,This phone is really the worst history if phone ever !!! Dont even bother ordering phone in this company its garbage ! They replace my original phone with even worst phone that u cant even turn it on ! I throw it in the garbage ! Never again waste if time and money !!! Piece of garbage !!!
Positive,"I was very disappointed, The phone did not work, it kept going off. I had the same phone before, after using it for about a year and half, it stated powering off the same thing this phone was doing. it seem as if they took an old phone, changed the cover and try to resell it."
Positive,i like my phone its great
Positive,love my phone!
Positive,This was not an fully unlocked phone!
Positive,I am a tractor trailer truck driver in all 48 states. Great Service!! Great phone!! No need for a computer with this phone.
Positive,Device arrived broken...
Positive,I will not buy nothing eles from this proson
Positive,"I received the item,but there's was a confusing,l though that was a Samsung galaxy note 4,but it's wasn't.but it's ok"
Positive,very nice phone and seller was very helpful
Positive,I purchased this device in February and now here it is May and my device has stopped working properly. I feel it is unfair that I can't return it any longer. Not to mention if I do a trade that Amazon will allow I won't even receive half my money back towards something else. It makes me even angrier thinking about how long I've had this device. I am Absolutely not satisfied!!!!!
Positive,Don't order this from us wireless it will quit working after not even quiet three month and they won't do anything about it and you are out a phone and $250
Positive,A very terrible phone moves very slow keep putting things up you don't want hate very much.
Positive,Didnt work for me
Positive,"I highly recommend this phone to anyone wanting a huge screen. And the quality is amazing! In addition, I found the slide out stylus very convenient to navigate the touch screen. I see no reason to purchase the Note 2 or Note 3 at this point unless you absolutely have to have the features they have that this one does not. But to spend that much more for the little extra you do get - not worth it. Just as with cars its best for your wallet to buy a few yeas back, I feel the same with this phone - It's best to get the Note now rather than Note 2 or Note 3."
Positive,Everything about this was perfect I've been using my phone for almost 4 months. I love it so much. Love
Positive,"I have a note 2 my niece wanted something close to it, this item was affordable and they worked with us, quite well, thank you so much."
Positive,"im very dissappointed with this product.....first off all i trust very much amazon.i order alot and idont have any problem with all my order.i even applied to be a prime.because i enjoy ordering.but the one item i order which is galaxy note 4gLTE 1717 16 GB unlocked gsm phone.i was very dissappointed.supposed to be my present to my wife when i went home in the philippines.when she first try to used it,there is no signal.she cannot make call and tex.the phone can use only for internet i bring it to the samsung center here in the philippines which is not cover of warranty.they told me the problem is the IMEI and the charge for that IMEI is 260 us dollar.which is big money.so i decide not to repair the phone.can the amazon do something about this...thank you"
Positive,"Everything is perfect. Just two flaws, my S Pen doesn't work at all but that's fine, I dont really use it and the back kinda pops off sometimes when I don't have in a case, but thats fine too cuz I have a case on all the time lol. So basically this phone is perfect. It came with original box and original cables, not headphones but I have dozens of pairs lol. Bought from DAC Enterprises for $218."
Positive,"Ordered this phone early December 2013 and it was delivered about December 17, 2013. On March 19, 2014 the screen was all black - all icons could not be seen. Us Wireless stated that 90 days warranty has passed since purchased so nothing can be done on their part. I thought the 90-day calculation commences on the delivery date when the customer has access to the phone. I will buy any item from that seller again and will definitely not recommend them. Next time I'll look for either FULFILLMENT BY AMAZOM or sold and shipped by Amazon"
Positive,"Great price very fast shipping, so much better than being under a phone contract with a carrier this way i get to choose who!"
Positive,"For the price, the Samsung Galaxy Note i717 is an excellent phone with a stunning screen. The upgrade from ICS to JellyBean 4.1.2 was a breeze. Enjoy."
Positive,excellent item
Positive,Great phone
Positive,thank you so much! i love this phone i use it as a tablet currently i will probably use straight talk with it in the future. i can use it like a regular phone to call and text with apps when I'm connected to wifi. i have had no problems except with the charger cord it lasted a monthish. i have to bend it weird ways and wrap it around my phone for it to charge but it still works. great phone i love it
Positive,great!
Positive,Phone sucked. It was slow froze up wouldn't hold a charge. Back didn't fit properly. Not worth being advertised or sold.
Positive,Very upset phone doesnt work had to send it back.
Positive,Works as expected I love it.
Positive,"Be Careful! Most smart phones listed as NEW are not! Many are posted in the wrong area and Amazon doesn't monitor this sufficiently. It's becoming an epidemic. This phone comes LOADED with bloatware most of which is running in the background constantly and using up precious little battery life. The battery is not sufficient for the phone and will have the phone on the charger more than not. I purchased the Zero Lemon 10,000 mah battery and case and it does much better. But, support in Texas is the worst I have seen (another review for another time). Great phone, I love it. But, the bloatware and battery life can be a hassle."
Positive,The phone sucks
Positive,biggest pile of crap ive ever seen
Positive,I ordered this galaxy note that cost me over $600 and I had chosen 1 day shipping. The seller said they would mail it out Monday for sure and didn't mail it out til Tuesday. The phone that was supposedly unlocked kept losing signal and had very bad echoing problems. The phone would lose signal after almost every phone call or texts and we would have to reboot. Then when we returned the phone almost a month ago.. Still no refund and now out of phone.
Positive,FANTASTIC! The only thing that I was not completely happy with was the shipment packaging. It was exactly as promised!
Positive,"Excellent arrived without problems and is requesting the product, it worked correctly, taking into account that almost half the world travel."
Positive,I would consider this to be one of the best services that I ever got on my online service purchase. I got the phone on prompt time considering that it was an APO Address. The phone itself is exactly as describes and performs to the required standards. It is truly an Unlocked phone and the size is what makes it Rock.. It performs the work of a phone as well as a Tablet. I can't wait to take it back to Kenya and brag.I would definitely recommend this phone to anyone who aspires to have a phone with large display and a Tablet with a smaller screen.
Positive,"The product is as expectedThis item is OK, I like itI recommend this product to everybodyThis product is good quality"
Positive,This phone was bought unlocked however I was unable to use in the Caribbean as the sim was not recognized. Simply had to return.Hope this can be rectified.
Positive,"Buyer beware. Of course being locked to all appearances I sent it back. Amazon was helpful in providing the return lable. People who want unlocked phones they could travel with would be sorely disappointed with this. Of course at $285 it might be worth paying a professional to unlock the phone as to carrier and region, but not to me."
Positive,"Everything is great with this phone after 9 days of use.Phone arrived sealed in packaging.Right out of the box,I inserted my family mobile sim card and the battery.Gave it a full charge,powered it up, and bam,made a phone call.The phone I received has android 4.04 (Ice Cream Sandwich). I think the firmware is upgradeable to 4.12 (jellybean). I have put a few apps on it,and have not found a reason to upgrade firmware yet.The phone is doing everything I need it to do so far (flawlessly).With mild text,calls,and fair internet usage at night,I'm gettin about 15 to 16 hrs of Battery between charges.This is a very big phone,but can still fit in someones pocket. I got a thin case for mine,and fabricated my own streamline (trustworthy) Holster."
Positive,This phone just got better when a developer over at XDA released a KitKat rom for this phone it is like I got a brand new phone and it is faster and smoother that it ever was stock.
Positive,"I love this phone and all the features.. However, I had a hard time sitting it up with straight talk.. They helped me set it up a bit frustrating but finally got it."
Positive,As advertised.came as new condition for a used item.completely happy with my purchase i would recommend this product to anyone.
Positive,"This product has livved up to it's expectations!! Came in excellent condition and functionality is top of the line.. Love it!! I will recommend this product to anyone based on my experience.. The features are cutting edge, the screen clarity are magnificent and overall an outstanding product."
Positive,"This note is perfect for me. I wanted the size, but not quite the bulk of the Samsung Mega. It is larger then the Galaxy 2, but once you get use to the size it is phenomenal. The internet speed is acceptable and the 4G lte is nearly as fast as my cable connections.I am not a senior citizen, but the size is quite helpful for those with less then perfect eyesight. The display and graphics are not perfect but quite adequate for my purposes. This is my third android, but by far the best.There will be no turning back from this device aside from a note upgrade."
Positive,the phone is less than 2 months but it doesn't work anymore. Was this a good phone???? I need a new phone or my money back
Positive,"I simply love this phone. This company Rocks! It arrived in 24hr! Great servic, great packaging, brand new, no problems! I highly recommend this to all!"
Positive,I love this phone easy no problem and is just AWSOME just hate trying to put a screen protector on
Positive,This phone work grate. I am in love with it. It like I have computer in my hand. I did not find any different between note 2 to note 1.
Positive,Wonderful buy the item is just as described. The carbon blue almost seems like black. The item was unlocked and ready for use. User friendly no worries at all.
Positive,"Awesome Phone, yes it's big easy to handle, nice camera, speed, and a lot of functions that will make your daily living easy. Battery may be an issue but if you reduce the brignest and minimize the amount of notiifications sounds this will longer all day long, i will recomend this to anyone and definetly will buy another one for my wife."
Positive,"I love it because it's big and it's most definitely everything I hoped for it to be, I'm a happy customer. I most definitely happy to had been a customer of the seller jmdurant, he's the best:)"
Positive,Bought this for my boyfriend xmas gift.. he loves it so much. Right size great speed.. phone is pretty amazing
Positive,"I bought this phone twice in the last month. The first one was perfect performance-wise, except that the USB port was defective and utterly useless. The phone would not take a charge unless you hold it at a certain angle. I returned it. The second phone worked perfectly except that it was way too sensitive to the S-Pen, that feature was utterly useless. About two weeks later, I began to have the same troubles with the USB port. The phone would not take a charge unless held at a certain angle. I returned the second phone yesterday. SAMSUNG must have known about the issue with the USB port from all the written reviews and complaints posted on Amazon, yet they continue to sell these phones for resale on Amazon. A big WTF! What will it take for Amazon to take any action? By all means people, DO NOT BUY this phone or you would just be wasting your time and money! DO NOT BUY!"
Positive,Wasn't at all what was advertised
Positive,No
Positive,The phone was exactly what I expected. Thank you!
Positive,WOW
Positive,"I bought this phone because my old one was missing a ton of calls, sending them straight to VM. I love the look and style of this phone. It came fully up to date with the jellybean thingy. I am with Metropcs and even though this is an AT&T phone they have a new thing where you can bring your own device. It cost me $45 to have it put onto metro service with a new sim card, but I feel it was worth it. Even the lady in the metro store fell in love with it and was showing it to the other staff! I'm still learning all the functions but overall I'm really happy with this phone."
Positive,I absolutely love this phone . Best phone by far that i have owned . I even bought my mom a phone like mine ans she loves it . I have no problems with this phone at all . Dont plan on getting another phone for a long time .
Positive,i think samsung is from korea.....but the one i bought is made in china!!!!!! im very disappointed about this phone
Positive,I am very pleased with my Samsung Galaxy Note. It's my first smartphone and boy is it smart lol. It's just what I wanted and needed. I am glad that I opted for this over the iphone.
Positive,Excenlent
Positive,great phone unfortunatley I cannot charge the battery while in the phone the charging port does not work so i have a separate charger for it. Wish I had bought it elsewhere.
Positive,"Hi,I ordered this phone last week and phone was really good only problem was wit its stylus. It can't be fitted in its space. its keep on falling again and again.So I raised return request."
Positive,"Very good buy, I am satisfied."
Positive,It's great
Positive,Great phoneüòÑ
Positive,"I love my little supercomputer and my ole tired eyes love the size. Delivered fast, works well and worked on crappy MetroPCS (but their service is not so good) and now on Aio, no problem. Less than half the price of the Note 3 but I do not know what it would do that I would want - this one does it all."
Positive,This phone is great. I have been using is for 3 mths now.It is unlocked as described and all you need to do is provide the sim card. It works very well and it is fast. It can play most games and other applications. I like that it has a lot of space As i download a lot of stuff.I have rather big hands and the keyboard on the screen is big enough to accommodate my fingers without making too many mistakes. The screen being big is also a good thing since it makes things such as text easier to see so you can do other things such as reading a book for example.The 8 mp camera takes great clear photos and the video isn't bad either.It comes with Android Gingerbread (v 2.3) but with the Samsung Keis software you can easily upgrade the phone to Jellybean (v 4.1.2)What I don't like about this phone is the the battery life is VERY poor.
Positive,"Cool phone, still going strong by the day.Just got #AnkerBatteries as backup batteries.Overall, this is a great phone."
Positive,Phone was brand new and works better than the phone my mom got originally from AT&T. I only paid $80.00 more than what the phone insurance was charging us for a replacement and the replacement wasn't the same phone. :(
Positive,"Tried the Notes 2,3 & the latest 4, and none came close to being as varied as the first Samsung Galaxy Note made.Love the Stylus (great for chubby fingers to use) and the Camera editing options are much more varied, almost limitless, and easy to figure out than the latest Notes; fantastic for tweaking & fine-tuning photography into artwork!I might have to buy another Samsung Note One, just to have ready for when (if ever) I need to replace the one I have.Love it! Love it!! Love it!!!"
Positive,"Everything is true..I am using T-Mobile and 4G LTE works fine.I like everything except battery issue. After I updated to 4.1.2 Jellybean, battery drains much faster than before.You need extra backup battery.I know that Firmware 4.4 Kitkat is on its way so hopely it will fix the problem.I definitely recommend to anyone need great smartphone"
Positive,"I give 5 star because it is a very nice phone. It has everything I wanted in a cell phone. I like the size because when I suft the web and read my email its like a little tablet. But when I used it as a phone, is little to big for me. I have to get use to it.Es muy bonito y tiene todo lo que deseo en un cellular. Me gusta mucho su tamano porque puede ver mejor mi correo y navegar en la red. Lo siento un poco muy grande cuando hago llamadas pero con el tiempo me acostumbrare a el."
Positive,"Holy SUGAR, HONEY, ICE, TEA! This i717 is AWESOME! I already gotten it Rooted. Deleted most of the Bloatware, AT&T apps mostly. I use this Phone/Tablet for movies purpose mostly. My Better-Half loves her movies on it. With a screen size over 5 inches, who wouldn't. The price was very good as well, for $307.00 with S&H included. Came brand new & unlocked, so you can use it with any Carrier that uses a regular Sim Card. The package came a ith all the necessary standred items, like USB Cable, Charger & instruction booklet. Very fast response, came with 4.0.4 I upgraded it to 4.1.2 without any upgrade though AT&T network, very nice colorful bright screen, easy to hold in your hand(s), if you have medium or large hand(s). It is just a great phone/tablet. S&H was bad, just came a day late, no problem!"
Positive,Wrong item
Positive,"FAKEnot a new phone . it was used as i even found the previous phone owner photo she and her family (Asians) , the phone was in good conduction but not new , i can say why she sold the phone , it's slow"
Positive,This phone is a piece of s*** do not buy will break in a month it keeps powering itself off and on I hate it not worth it at all
Positive,excelente note
Positive,Awesome product and price!!!! A+++!!!
Positive,"This product is wicked!! Fast phone, long lasting battery and nice screen size!!! Also the audio and picture quality are really HD"
Positive,This is the first unlocked phone I purchased so I was a little nervous about if and how well it would work. It turns out that it works great. All I had to do was get a SIM card from my cell phone provider and it fired right up and works great.I love the big screen with a stunningly detailed HD display. Apps run great without any lag at all.
Positive,"I had The HTC Inspire before i bought this phone. I had been searching for a phone because mine was not work the way it should be. I saw this one and I thought it had a lot of great features. I read the reviews before i purchased it. I kept seeing other people ay that the battery dies a little fast. Yes, that is true. BUT that is the ONLY bad thing I don't like about this phone. This phone works so well. The screen is big ad the features are great. My advice for others that hate having a phone where the battery dies, get back up batteries. I bought and extra pair of batteries so I wouldn't have to worry about my phone dying in a random place, when i needed it the most. This pone is really nice phone. If you've had an android before, this is really easy to navigate. I recommend this phone, especially to phone that are iphone users. I also had an iphone and i loved it but i love this one WAY better."
Positive,This is a great phone. It can do everything just right. Reception is very good. This product came quicker than they said and came exactly the way they described. I recommend to all.
Positive,"I must say I am extremely happy with this purchase. The phone it self is worth every penny. I honestly love all the apps it comes with and the options it gives you for sms etc. The camera is great it takes hd quality pictures & video cam is the same. I skype on the phone frequently and the front facing camera is great as well my video is clear on skype. The phone worked perfectly on the straight talk network, I just bought the sim card from straight talk and the 45 dollar unlimited bundle and was able to activate the phone with ease the only thing is that once you activate this phone on the straight talk website your call and texting will work however to get on their data network you must update ur apn setting to straight talk but not to worry its very easy to do so just contact straight talk like I did and they will guide you from there and it will only take you around 5 minutes total and there you are done and can enjoy your phone fully. Your welcome. P.S I would call in the early morning because they close at 12 in the afternoon eastern time. But over all this is a great phone with exellent features especially like the stylus pen, I really enjoy using it because its fun and conveintent."
Positive,"I was worried that being unlocked would not be enough because I was not using AT&T as my cell provider. I was wrong. It has truley exceeded all of my expectations. The only thing I can't get it to do so far is to update with new software, via Kies Air."
Positive,exelente
Positive,excellent
Positive,"I love my new phone, the shipping was great it got her eariler than expected. The phone is in great condition, plus there was a screen protector already with the phone. Really exceeded my expectations."
Positive,"I loved this phone but the refurbished one I received had the screen not reattached properly. Not the phones fault! It was awesome, but I ended up with the note 2 instead."
Positive,To be honest I was not satisfied with the purchase. I paid a lot of money for this phone till i found out that it was messing up. I thought it was a glitch like every other phone does. NO! It started getting worse. It started to freeze and then all of a sudden it stopped charging. Now i can't turn the phone on. I tried contacting the seller. Can't do nothing about it since they only gave me one month of warranty!
Positive,"Awwww yeah, I love this thing. Only recommendation I have is to root it out and install an underclocking app...that way you can help with the battery life."
Positive,"I was very happy with my purchase. This phone is great all though it might be too big for some people, I personally don't mind. The phone is great came in super fast and the packaging was very good to, it came in two boxes so it was well protected."
Positive,"I got the phone and it had a problem so I contacted the seller and he took care of me right away. I have a working phone now and I really like this phone. It has a big clear screen, high quality voice reception, and it is easy to read. It has plenty of room on my 32GB removable SD card to hold lots of pictures and videos. Showing off the grandkids is great. It takes wonderful pictures, too. I am on the NET10 system for my phone system. NET10 is a sister to Strait Talk and is owned by Tracfone. Doesn't have much customer service, but the really tried to work with me to get my phone up and running. They just didn't know how to diagnose what was wrong. Anyway, the bottom line is that this is a great phone and a super seller."
Positive,"I must start by saying ""I love my new phablet"". To be honest the seller did not truely described how pristine the device was; literally. The package included a brand new charger, protective screen and a hard case. I must say I got more than what I payed for.Pros: A huge screen, Lots of apps, S-Pen is wonderful,Cons: The batteryAll in all apart from the battery its an alround device that gets me through the day"
Positive,"I didn't like the packing. It was so delicate. I didn't like that there was not much information on the product. I trust Amazon approved sales so I thought I would get a charger, there wasn't any. It says unlocked but I didn't get the unlock key. It wasn't specified that it had scratches at the bottom"
Positive,love it
Positive,"These products superve Very, very satisified. Couldn'task for any greater service anywhere. I would recommend these products and your service to everyone. Great job great service. Keep up the great work. George R. Downs, Emerson, Geoorgia"
Positive,Have had a lot of issues wuth pgone csnt turn it off abd it doss not charge
Positive,This is the worse thing i have done with my money in the last 31 years. This is the worse phone i have seen in my life. Started freezing the first day i thought it was nothing that maybe i was too excited but its up to a month now and this trash call a phone freezes more than 50 times a day. I have to restart it every time i try to make a call or use it. Don't even buy it for your worse enemy in the world because its like running a scissors through your money. Cal me and i will confirm 2404869256.
Positive,"I guy tablets and telephones often because we do surveys with them. I bought 5 of these particular Galaxy notes. Within months 4 of them only worked sometimes. It's been less than 1 year now. None have been used more than few weeks total and 3 are inoperative. I bought new batteries....Didn't help. I also bought five new Samsung 7 inch tablets. Two of the GPS never worked. Three years ago I was swearing by Samsung. Now I'll never buy another. Blu's are better, more reliable, good independent GPS chip and less than 1/2 the price."
Positive,"FAKE FAKE.FAKE. So I get the package open it up and begin.to put.the back case on , battery in, etc. Only to notice that the rear camera is crooked causing the.back case to not snap on all the way. So I.go to plug the charger in and it doesn't charge. I tried 13 diff.chargers. NONE worked. This is a cheap knock off of the real deal. The first day I bought it it was priced at $242.00 it has since dropped 11 dollars and.ive.noticed every day it.drops more and.more. very strange."
Positive,"This is a good phone and takes very good pictures, i would highly recommend this phone especially for international use"
Positive,"Love it, love it. I can't say enough about this phone. It's stylish and big like I like it. I get so many compliments on this phone."
Positive,Only complaint is that I can't find the fm tuner setting. And that's my complaint not hers. Otherwise a great but huge phone.
Positive,"I've been an iPhone user for the last 4 years, but when my 3gs finally crapped out for good I researched long and hard and settled on the Note. I LOVE it. It's easy to use and I love the size. It feels solid in my hand. It seems screaming fast compared to my old iPhone, too. UPDATE on 8/16: The first one I received had internal antenna issues, but I sent it back and got another one that works perfectly! I've had the phone for a couple of months now and have had no problems using it on T-Mobile and I am getting 4g LTE speeds whenever they are available. Love this phone!"
Positive,"once you go note there's no going back to anything with a smaller screen!!! I love this phone, after update runs like a champ...better than iphone, nokia, tablets, soooooo happy!!!"
Positive,Overall a great phone its not the most new note but it gets the job done the software update made it like a note 2 so overall I am happy with my debice
Positive,"Came brand new in box, ATT packaging, charger and USB cord which was fine because I am an ATT customer. Works perfectly ! I put my SIM and memory card in and was all set . Mine was black but I did not care about the color. The LCD died on my old one so this worked out nicely and the price was good."
Positive,The phone works great!!
Positive,It is good phone and very dear price. I will buy another one if I get a chance.
Positive,Excelente.........
Positive,"I'm sorry but no this phone does not meet my expectations. firstly the battery dies easily i had to purchase a new one, and the screen twitches so i think i soon have to replace it......... i bought this phone to use in jamaica didn't notice all it faults until lately ...."
Positive,"If u want a good phone that you can use on any GSM network, especially Straight Talk, ATT&T or T-Mobile I would strongly recommend that you buy this phone."
Positive,"After receiving the phone I find out (the hard way) the phone is defective and will not charge. After spending almost 3 hours on the phone with samsung, they were able to help me diagnose the issue."
Positive,The unlock phone does not work without being connected to the internet. With my up coming trip and the fact I have a lot of medical issues I need a phone I can use were ever I am.
Positive,This phone is awesome...1. its unlocked2. came in three days3.loading really fast4. works with Tmobile5. easy to manage6. don't have any issue with apps..i downloaded all apps that i wanted and download speed is really fast7. everything that was included in the package is working8. batter don't drain fast :)9. I would recommend to anyone to get this phone....Overall I'm happy with this product...second day using this phone and I'm amazed
Positive,"This cell phone screen is amazing, with s pen, i can use it for emailing and the camera is good."
Positive,"Love this phone got it on the Straight talk network. It came with no SIM card, so I ordered a Straight Talk SIM card from All Cellular of Irving TX on Amazon and phone works awesome, good battery life and many cool functions. I also got an Otter case for it, and this is a must !! Fast shipping by this company."
Positive,I love this phone. It's fun and has everything I need and more in a cell phone. It took a bit to get used to the stylus but it was so great I got the Note Tablet too.
Positive,"Now after more than 3 months I am still happy with the SGH-i717.I wish that I could erase some of AT&T stuff that I don't need such their Navigation (since I am T-Mobile customer). I can get 4G LTE screen is bigger than Galaxy S2 that I had previously. Compared to previous the only CON, you can't talk to Navigation to show you routes - only typing. Overall very happy withi the product and the money I paid for it."
Positive,"Except for the battery life, this phone is perfect for my current needs. This is the best way for me to enter the smartphone arena."
Positive,"i cant tell how excited i was to use my new phone, it was delivered safe and sealed.and im enjoying it."
Positive,EXCELLENT product. Excellent customer service. I could not be more happy with my purchase. I will use them anytime I need a phone or accesories. I will be telling all my friends and family what a great experience I had and suggest that they use them. I am one HAPPY customer!
Positive,So far It's Good .world Well no complaint. Great phone like I said.more capabilities. And fast to work with. Enjoy
Positive,"I love this little phone because it is so handy and will do everything my larger 10 inch tablet does, but is also a phone and a lot easier to carry around.. The video is so clear and this is large enough to do email or text comfortably. I highly this even if you don't get phone service because you are still able to do everything with the Wifi component AND if you have Magic Jack like I have you can get the Magic Jack app and still use it as a phone whenever you are around a Wifi source."
Positive,I purchased this phone because I thought I was buying an unlocked phone without any carrier. This phone has AT&T logos all over it and the box it came in looked like it has been open and smashed. After careful review I think this phone may have been refurbished and they are selling it as new unlocked. What a Joke! I expected better from Amazon!
Positive,"After just 4 months, I have replaced this phone with Galaxy Note 3. I love the Samsung galaxy Note and now have had all three versions. I actually have been very happy with this product as long as it is factory unlocked but this phone was the AT&T unlocked version and had lots of issues. Worst part was the interference by AT&T and it has been the slowest of any of the trree I have had. As I need the phone for business, speed is important. I would certainly recommend the Galaxy Note, just not this phone!!!"
Positive,Awesome phone! great apps and just awesome!!! I love it. Got the best apps and a very fast phone overall
Positive,Awesome!
Positive,The phone has a key code. I can't use it
Positive,I bought this phone for my fiance's birthday. She absolutely loves it! I had a Note 2 prior to me owning the Note 3 & I loved it also.There are a lot of things about the Note 2 I like over the Note 3. This is not about that though.We use UsCellular as our carrier and it works great with them. It was shipped right away. Service was great.
Positive,"The microphone has problem when using earphone. Others couldn't hear my voice clearly. I tried different brands of earphone including HTC, Samsung and another brand. The problem was still there. I asked for seller's help but just noticed to wait their manager's respond. Finally I got manager's attention but he said ""it sounds the earphones are not loud enough for you. It does not mean the phone is bad. Did you try another headset?"" Due to this inefficiency, I decided to return this phone and asked for return label. Again, one person asked me to wait for manager's return instruction. However from 3 days ago until now, I didn't see any word from the manager who is very hard to reach. Unlike other seller's wonderful customer service, I was disapointed at the poor, inefficient customer service experience this time."
Positive,"Just got my Samsung Galaxy Note 2 from Worldwide Distributor.It's a white device and international unlocked N-7100.It's very awesome, and the whole device, I don't see a single problem.The device runs fast and zero lag.Love this device so much."
Positive,"Like the title states, i actually love this device so much and it performs so flawlessly, there is absolutely no reason to root.In the past there was the need to install voodoo lag fix, aps to SD, change LCD density, take screen shots, remove bloatware, tether hotspot, overclock to get better performance, maybe install ROMS that had unofficial latest updates of Android O/S, maybe to get some latest & greatest cloned features of the newest smartphone....etc etc etc...Rooting always had risks involved, but i always found it WORTH THE CHANCE,to be able to ""enjoy my phone to the max""....Well, guess what? Samsung has delivered every possible above named scenerio all in one SUPERPHONE!Mind you, with my other phones, i ALWAYS rooted within one hour of owning... Going on 3 whole days here and there's not a chance i would put my new little Angel in possible harms way for little or no gain that root provides.Don't get me wrong, IF you truly know what your doing, rooting & ROM'ing is awesome...I however, never could grasp a full understanding of the internal workings of android no matter how much i read, and therefore when i would root, things sometimes would go wrong, i found it very stressful, even tho very necessary... But that was then, & thanx to the G-Note 2, THIS is now... No root for this gal : )Pros:First and foremost, smooth feel and amazing touch sensitivity of screen....HD Super Amoled is as good or better than S Amoled Plus - quality of images and fonts is best I have ever seen on any phoneSooooo ::::fast:::: ZERO lag and i already have 50+ apps addedSo many amazing exclusive Samsung features (motion/Sbeam/S-pen etc)Sooooo ::::fast:::: ZERO lagExcellent build qualitySooooo ::::fast:::: ZERO lagVery loud volumeSooooo ::::fast:::: ZERO lagBattery life is fantastic..Play with it nonstop all day still over 50%Sooooo ::::fast:::: ZERO lag2GB Ram & 1.6 Quad Core Exynos proc... wowza!Camera is fast and great qualityJellybean O/S on this phone is the icing on the cake..oh & did i mention its sooooo fast? lolSeriously, a better Android experience you WILL NOT FIND.And if you think its too big, think about this: Experts predict just about EVERYONE will have 5-6 inch devices as their personal device within 2 yearsTGG*****UPDATE*****STRAIGHT TALK:Wanted to add what i put in that other post for anyone thinking of buying & using this device with Straight Talk- It works awesome:I saw their poor coverage map when i first signed on 5 mos ago and i was like ""whaaaa?"" I was amazed they could generate business with such a poor map on their OWN site but then because sooooo many ppl said they were getting great coverage despite those maps, i figured i'd TRY it. I figured i'd run BOTH for one month (at a cost of 45.00 + 15.00 activ fee) but honestly after just 3 days coverage was so awesome and comparable to AT&T i cancelled ATT immediately and from that point on never ONCE had an issue. ST is unlike most bargains because this gift keeps on giving with every months bill : )*****UPDATE*****Regarding NO WARRANTY:The company i purchased from (WORLDWIDE DISTRIBUTORS) ships out of California and all their devices are from ONE place (Samsung UK and the device has a 30 day warranty with THEM & then a 1 year mfg with Samsung UK. I asked her how painful the process is and she said she had to send them her own personal device last year and it was a totally non hassel experience, cost her nothing and she said she was without the phone for just 2 weeks...They welcome any questions before ordering (theres a 1-888# in their profile) so nice & helpful. They have high ratings, 33000+ this year alone. For just 29.00 they Fed Exed overnite. Very happy with my purchase*****UPDATE*****TWO WEEKS LATER:Not one complaint and i am still in complete awe of how flawlessly this device runs. Not one issue : ) This is the FIRST device i ever had where i didn't notice a ""ticking clock of my 14 or 30 day return period"".From practically the moment i turned it on and began using it, it was ""home"" and there was just no way i would want to return it and wait for the ""the next best thing""... I honestly can see being happy with the device for at least ONE YEAR (maybe even more!) regardless of what comes out.And i still wouldn't dream of rooting it, and this is from someone that has rooted approx 30 devices and in the past wouldn't even consider using an UNROOTED Android device : )Straight Talk still running flawlessly on it, avg approx 3-5MB consistantly...."
Positive,Nice has worked for years now and have loaded many roms.
Positive,Great price. Excellent fit
Positive,bien
Positive,i love my phone alot i can put it down
Positive,"GREAT, PERFECT IN VENEZUELA WITH FUNCTIONAL LS TTRES TELEPHONE COMPANIES"
Positive,Good Product
Positive,Is a good phone to buy.is amazing I love it. I will recommend this for someone to buy. Is good.
Positive,"Excelente tlf de EXCELENTE calidad, sin duda el mejor del mercado, realmente lo amo mas que a mi novio :D. estoy mas que contenta con mi galaxy note II"
Positive,"In my earlier review I had given 5 stars. Still I will hold that view with respect to my phone. But the after sales service from the seller FGS trading is too bad. My phone suddenly died after 9 months. When i contacted the Samsung support in US they said the phone is an international one and can not be repaired in US. When i reached out to FGS trading, they said it can not be repaired in US and that they had mentioned the fact at the time of sale. However, at the time of sale the title only said no warranty, it did not specify that even manufacturer warranty can also be not claimed in US or even out of US. This is pure misrepresentation of facts. When i told the seller that US support is not providing repairs they replied that you can try in UK but Samsung is not a very warranty friendly company. This is serious breahc of trust and very poor customer back up. Do not fall in the trap of third party sellers, even if you have to pay some extra money, buy it only from Amazon. These third party sellers will not provide you any support of any kind."
Positive,"This Phone is so the Bomb. It beats the SIII and Iphone 5.It can at the right day before late ship.The problem thing is when a got this phone, it's in German-the manual and so as the phone but I changed it to English- the phone.Anyways you gotta get this phone its awesome. Quad-core is special. the phone is so fast.The Next Launcher is the thing that drinks it's battery.Anyways get this phone!!Buy'em!!! Before the sell out so BUY'EM!You'll love it!"
Positive,"It's not that big, it's a great phone, and the display is just amazing, I'm very pleased with the product."
Positive,"This phone has everything you need. It's a tablet and a phone. With a 5.5 in. screen, you can see everything and watching videos on it is ridiculously awesome. The two cameras take thee best pictures I have ever seen. All-around great phone"
Positive,First time to try an android device and I can sa that I am very much satisfied with this purchase. Larger screen size is worth the extra bulk compared to my iphone 4s. No issues so far :)
Positive,I did not get the review of the individual who received the package. I will know soon. Overall Sansung makes good products
Positive,awesome phone! got here quick too! very impressed. i was a little nervous paying so much online ar first....but when my package arrived i was very relieved. thank you
Positive,"I won't go into deals about the phone because I think others have done really good reviews (read reviews from the gray phone as well) but I will go into details about my experience.Here are few things I want to focus on:1- INTEGRATION: what I mean here is the integration between apps and the main functionality of the phone. I use the calling feature a lot ( expected ) but also I don't want to launch each individual social app to find someone I want to SMS/Chat/Call. Basically it has a ""universal"" contacts so if you use Tango/Viper/WhatsApp/Skype/Google Voice you will find it so easy to find the person and do whatever you want. I make lots of international calls so I use 3rd party app to make phone calls (along with GVoice). I've used this 3rd party with the iPhone but it was buggy and it always crashes plus I have to launch it each time and find a person to call. With Android, I can just configure the app to be used when I call internationally. The same goes for Google Voice.2- NOTIFICATION: I use social apps like WhatsApp alot but with the iPhone it used to drain battery and not work properly with the iOS notification. I've to open it all the time to make sure someone is talking to me. The notification for this phone (probably Android thing) is just amazing. With the power and memory of this phone, all apps just push their notification smoothly. Slide down with your finger from top to bottom and you see all your notifications. It could get annoying but you can always turn it off or silent your phone.3- S-PEN: As others have mentioned, this is probably the best part of the phone. I can't imagine not using it and believe me you will just love it. It has so much features and is very precise when writing. I use it almost all the time.4- BATTERY: I charge the phone at night only. I use it from the time I wake up till I charge it again at midnight. I won't exaggerate if I say that I use it heavily from sending emails, to lots of FB to youtube to all social apps (Skype/SMS/WhatsApp/Viper/Tango) to email and lots of browsing and it will survive till the end of the day. The screen is almost on 75% of the time. I have to say that while it is not a PC but I've not used my PC that much since I got this phone.5- SPEED: with all the points above, switching between all the apps I work with is just blazing fast. No lag whatsoever. It is very fast and loads quickly.6- MULTI-TASKING: You can literally use two apps at the same time (not all apps though). Just drag an app from the side menu to the screen and it will split both ups (top and bottom)7- AUTO-COMPLETE/SENTENCE COMPLETION: it is so amazing smart I literally type few letters and it gives me so many options to finish. It also predicts the next word based on your selection and you type a 15 words SMS in 5 seconds. As an FYI, it does this for more than ONE language I use (English/Arabic). With the iPhone, it was really a piss off. Each time it overwrites what I type and I keep hitting the erase/back key on the keyboard.8- CONTINUOUS WRITING: For both languages I use - again - I just move the S-PEN (or my finger) on the keyboard and it will accurately finish words for me. I am honestly surprised at its accuracy. About 90% of the time it is always correct. English accuracy is higher than when I type in Arabic.9- SIMPLE MOBILE/T-MOBILE: I live in Northern VA and there are so many new towers with the 1900 band. However only when I am next to them I get 3G/HSPA+ but the speed - while driving; I know :) - is about 5.5Mbps down and 2.5Mbps uploads. 99.9% of the time I am on EDGE. I might move to Simple Talk but to be honest I do a lot of SMS internationally. If Simple Talk will cut off my line when sending couple of International SMSs then that would be crazy. The majority of my time is at work or at my home. At work I use the PC so I don't care about 3G/4G while at home I use my Wifi. At the end of the day, you need to really evaluate your needs. EDGE is more than enough for me for email/light social apps.10- TABLET ALTERNATIVE: I would only use a table for reading books since I've 100's of technical PDF books. I've read few large Apress PDF technical books and I can see myself reading from this phone straight. I don't think it will be ideal but it was just so hard on the iPhone since I was constantly zooming in and out.11- FINGERPRINTS: I am not sure if I read some reviews that said it does not get fingerprints easily but this is not true. It is like a magnet and don't listen to their reviews.Finally, I was lucky to get my two phones from Amazon LLC and not a third party seller. I just don't trust these guys for the amount I paid for my phones and I was lucky to get the last two white ones. I've really enjoyed the phone every time I use it and it is worth every penny. I don't think I need to jump to any phone for few years to come (unless I break this, hopefully not).Finally thanks to all the previous 5-star reviewers here at Amazon. They've done really a good job giving this phone with it deserves."
Positive,"Purchased this lovely cellular device for my mother, she loves it, only thing it resets itself when you turn it off but it might be her phone provider that does it. Anyways it's a good phone for anyone. Long battery life."
Positive,Ive changing phone a lot but this one ive use kt 8 months then i change it for an iphone 5 (huge mistake) android phone are the best ones
Positive,Best phone i ever had. Completely satisfied. Fast delivery. Very happy. Dont have 1 single complaint. Cut my straight talk sim from a google search template. Installed perfect. Works great. Even got flashplayer and pdf reader installed.
Positive,Grest product and excellent customer service. Since I brought the product I havr not had any issues eith it. The company I got it from went out of their way to even provide me with an adaptor.
Positive,wow it isbest greatest best smartest phone ever.I choose that so many people recommend me to have this.I really feel so gooooooooooooooooooooooooooood having this phone
Positive,Le doy 5 estrella porque es una maquinaMe gusta por que el tel√©fono es otro nivelLo recomiendo por que le va a impresionar
Positive,I just LOVE this phone..everyday I discover more ..It is everything I need in one complete package.Service from the shipper was amazing..I had it shipped to a friend at a hotel who was bringing it to me..I worried about the time frame and emailed the shipper...they responded immediately and said no worries! It arrived on time ..
Positive,"Spectacular, as you can read elsewhere. Some things I like that don't get talked about as often as others: - removable battery. About $20 to get a spare battery and charger. Don't plug in, just swap batteries. - standard cables. Inexpensive - Strong, thin back that you can rip off and smear back on every day without damage. Makes for a light phone that's less slippery."
Positive,"A_Mazing! This is the best phone/tablet I've ever had in my hand by far. Thinking about it? Buy it. The features are futuristic, and it's lighting fast. I ordered a straight talk sim, and it was plug and play."
Positive,I do have one issue the OS does not allow to install apps on microSD card hope that OS updates will resolve this issue
Positive,"it's a great Phone, I like it...it's fast, it's really cool, it's good for business, good for internet, good for every thing..."
Positive,A very interesting and enjoyable phone. The best of the galaxy generation so far. I am using it as a phone and also as a computer. The price is expensive but it is worth it. This is my second phone of the samsung galaxy generation after the galaxy s2.
Positive,"I've had this phone for about 2-3 weeks now. I'm coming from using an iphone 3g so it's hard for me to compare to it's true peer the iphone 5.Pro's- Large screen, lots of apps, good touch response, good rear speaker, quick processing power.Con's- It's take a while to handle it so you're not activating something on the screen. Also the power button on the side should be moved to the top like and Iphone. Not sure if thats some sort of patent thing, but it just adds to one more button to accidently pushing during handling. Also IMO...all buttons should be more flush with the body to help prevent accidental pressing. These button stick out just enough to be accidently pressed during handling. I just didn't have this problem with an even smaller Iphone.I haven't used it as a phone yet because I'm overseas and will be returning home soon. FYI, it uses a mini sim card. What I do like is my computer picks up the phone with no issues like an external device so makes transfering files easy.I find the stylus pretty useless. The few times I have used it, the action isn't very responsive. Maybe I'm using it wrong?Another problem I don't like is when I'm texting in landscape mode, the keyboard takes up the whole screen except for the line on top I'm typing so I can't easily reference the material above that line. Everything works normal in portrait mode. Not sure if this issue is my phone or a android thing. Maybe there's another keyboard app? Haven't tried.One of my big things is using unlocked phones, and I also liked the size so overall I like this phone and it suites my needs."
Positive,"Great item; but you have to get use to its size. Works well, but you my have a problem finding a sim card for it. But you can find a sim card cutting template on the internet. So service providers will cut one for you if they don't sell them already. With that issue out of the way I am sure you will be more than happy with the unit. Note that many of the apps for this unit can be downloaded for free. That being sad remember that music, photos, data files, and apps eat up the phones memory and battery; invest in an additional battery if you are using the phone to do more than make calls and you will. Also consider getting no less than 32GB of additional memory."
Positive,"I used to be an iphone fan, if you are considering to change to the Samsung Galaxy, dont hesitate, the software blew me away!, same as the iphone 3g did. I could see the rabbit and turtle story apply to Apple and Samsung. Relating to the size, it is perfect for the real multitasking (not running in the back, just in front) , see movies, it is really no reason to have a tablet. Besides I have received a lot of good comments related the screen definition. I am still learning : there are so many details and configuration: besides you can add the 64gb to expand to 80gb if like me buy the 16gb model. Also i use the S pen a lot."
Positive,"If I had known that ""International"" means limited internet in US, and always roaming; I never would have bought the phone.So I sent it back."
Positive,mora than expected I definitly recomend it. if you do t care care size. great for womans we alwYs got a purse so size is no problem at all.
Positive,"I recently purchased this for my wife, whose Galaxy 1 started to become well used. The size is between a galaxy 2 and a 7"" tablet. Basically it is a slightly smaller tablet you can also use as a phone. Keyboard size is good. I got the unlocked version because her service provider does not have this model available yet. Android 4 appears to be very stable, and most of your earlier version apps will transfer.As a plus, this model comes with a built in stylus like the new Galaxy Note 10.1 which is very handy."
Positive,"This product satisfied my expectations, is much better than all others smartphones i had. It seems to be very big but once you get used to it you realize is the perfect size, great native apps the S pen y the best."
Positive,The Note 2 arrived as scheduled and it is in perfect condition. The phone is amazing and I am very happy with my purchase. I have no complaints or criticism with the phone or the seller as everything is just as it was advertised. I would recommend both the phone and the seller.
Positive,"I am so happy I purchased this. I have an S3 but the Note 2 is so much better. The titanium gray finish makes it look sleek and elegant, a nice change from white or black. I use an international micro SIM card purchased from Amazon and it works well. I got online through Wi-Fi and downloads were quick. My apps were easy to install and use. I needed an unlocked international version because I travel around the world and I need a phone that can roam on 2G or 3G networks. I also added a 64GB microSD card for listening to music and audiobooks. I can replace my iTouch and not have to carry 2 devices, plus the microSD card slot lets me carry more than the on-board storage. I like having options and the Note 2 gives me plenty.03/15: I set up my music and listened through my Bose headphones. The sound is great and I can change the ambience to bass boost or I can customize my listening settings. I set up my playlists and the graphics are good quality and brilliant colors. I spent the afternoon taking photos with my Note 2 and they came out great. The quality was so much better than my point&shoot. I also got some video with sound that is amazingly good. Transferring the photos and videos to my PC was easy. Owning this device just eliminated another item I no longer need to carry. I travel a lot and I usually carry my iPad + cell phone + camera. This would replace all those easily. My only two wishes were that it used a regular SIM card rather than a microSIM card and that it came in the same gorgeous garnet red as the limited edition Galaxy Tab 2 7"". I found a deep red flip cover, so here's hoping it will be beautiful. I am very happy with my purchase!04/27: The Amigo flip cover for this device is a beautiful deep berry red. I get compliments on both the case and the phone wherever I go. I'm taking advantage of the daily free Android apps that are compatible. I've gotten some great free apps through Amazon's program.05/16: I have traveled to several different countries in Africa and I have had no trouble using my phone service. Service depends on the carrier, not the device. Some countries do not recognize my SIM card for calls but let me send/receive SMS text messages. My device still rocks! I'm using it a lot more these days than my iPad. I still need my iPad for movies, though, because Amazon Instant Video (download) is not for android devices, just the Kindle, the iPad and the PC. I hope that will change one day because the Note 2 is great for watching video content. I've watched some YouTube videos on this and the quality is execellent."
Positive,"excelente producto, altamente recomendado pues las mejoras con respecto al samsung galaxy note 1 se nota las diferencia mayor rendimiento y f√°cil manejo"
Positive,este telefono es una maravilla muy rapido me gusta mucho es muy facil de usar realmente estoy encantada de haberlo comprado
Positive,"CANT PUT DOWN my fone! so much to explore and discover!one of the best gadgets/fones i ever had!!Only DOWNER is - i got myself a 64gb scandisk memory bcos by internal memory is just 10gbs - BUT - unfortunately these fones need to be rooted then get download some apps etc...Why cant the fone just give me option to save my apps and media on internal or external memory?Its quite a hassle if you are not a techie type.So now im left with doing all that setting up external memory so that i could download more apps and have space for my media files.otherwise like i said - i love this phone. My bf got iphone 5, but compared to mine - mine is def so much better and bigger.sometimes my bf gets jealous.its really enjoyable piece of gadget."
Positive,"The Note II is a very good CP. It is a very good Tablet. Together they are a great product, The two cams, one front and one rear, is really nice. Can use the front for im and the rear for making movies and taking still photos.If had larger memory is about the only complaint. Need at least 64 GB for the cams.Any one looking for a Tablet or a CP should check this unit out. They are combined into a nice package here."
Positive,I like this phone especially the screen. People say that the screen is huge but you get used to it. It's like a mini iPad
Positive,"VERY GOOD!!!GREAT PRODUCTS, RECOMEND ITSIMPLE TO USEGOOD PRICEGOOD BATERYGOOD 3SIGNALOK WHEIGTVERY SIMPLE INSTRUCCIONSRECOMEND"
Positive,there are so many feature that this phone have that iphone don't and both of them have relatively the same price.I
Positive,"I really like this phone, But it's not fit for everybody. It might be too big to some of you, but that was what i liked the most in this phone, i barely use my computer now! The camera is very clear, very fast phone, i enjoy watching clips and surf the net. Reading and writing an e-mail is so convenient. The only disadvantage i discovered is very easy to break. I dropped it once and it's cracked, so be careful."
Positive,"This is the first smartphone that I bought and at first I'm kind of hesitant on buying an unlocked international version because of some reviews that I have read. Buying this phone is very worth it and I love all of it's feature. Also, the phone arrived on time and in good condition."
Positive,"Best smart phone I ever had. I don't need a tablet.Is just the right size, and the battery life last for 20 hours with heavy use."
Positive,"Happy with the purchase so far. Worth every penny. Had a Nokia N8 for almost 2 years before this so was looking for a major upgrade. Feels a little awkward when taking a call, but barely do that anymore (and usually just use the loudspeaker when I do). Screen is huge and awesome, feels like I've barely tapped the potential of the thing but I already use it for loads of stuff I never thought I'd do on a smartphone (some art, note jotting, watching short clips, music, even get to work a bit with dropbox integration and a latex editor. Highly recommended if you need a powerhouse at the tip of the finger and can embrace the big screen (I grew tired of trying to read on small ones really)."
Positive,excellent phone and good apps available. was interested in the I phone but decided on the Note. no regrets there.
Positive,"The HD Super AMOLED display provides clarity, has a larger screen, but keeps your body lean that fits your hand perfectly. The quad-core processor 1.6 GHz integrated offers powerful performance and the S Pen offers several additional functions."
Positive,"OMG I love this phone, I will never change it. Fast deliver and good product. I recieved it even before the time that was in the order. Thank you for the good service"
Positive,"A few months ago I purchased a note 2 from this seller and everything was fine. Since I had a good experience with them and needed another note 2, I decided to buy another one from them. Unfortunately the person who was going to use it in my company did not need it so I asked to return. Not only did I have to pay for the return shipping, the seller charged me a 15% restocking fee. I understand some fee should be charged but 15% is a rip off. They just lost a customer with me and all my 60 employees.I recommend if you are going to buy a note 2 do so from Amazon just in case you might return."
Positive,"1. I ordered a titanium and got a white one.2. The phone is a used one. I dumped it into the river nearby as it was not what I thought I paid for.The supplier is definitely dishonest!In fairness, Amazon is normally better than this!Carlos G Santos"
Positive,"It surppass my expectations in many aspects! I like the funcionality and the speed, but I dislike the price. I already recomended this product to many friends."
Positive,everything about this is great so far. sharp looking images and error free touch screen. I could be wrong but even the battery lasts longer than my other phone
Positive,Purchased as a anniversary gift for my husband. He just loves it and is enjoying learning and using all of the wonderful features. Works great when we skype too. Is very user friendly and would love to get one for myself now.
Positive,Completely satisfied with the purchase of this product ...!
Positive,"Awesome phone. After 3 yrs, still using mine. Just did factory reset and updated all apps. Works well and the phone is snappy."
Positive,Exelent
Positive,Excelente
Positive,"The phone was great while it lasted which is a little under 2 years. I am unable to fix it due to the fact that it is an unlocked phone - an ""international"" version, Samsung has refused to diagnose the issue for me. So, I guess it's a total loss. It's a shame because the phone was a pleasure to use and very reliable, until now. I expected it to last longer! I'm not allowed to write anything about the seller here so that's all I have to say."
Positive,Buyers be aware!!! Cellphone has not warranty in USA or any other part except in Slowakia . So if you want to buy a cellphone without any support BUY AT YOUR OWN RISK. BE AWARE OF SELLER THEY ARE NOT HONEST.
Positive,"Buy it, at your on risk, be aware you will have no warranty support from Samsung neither from the store.If you open the box and the N7100 is not working or stops to work few weeks after,as happened with my one, you threw your money on the waste.Be always on the safe side, buy hw with warranty.Good lucky."
Positive,I absolutely love this phone. I bought it for travelling originally and now I use it at home too. The only down side is be prepared for the Oooh's and Ahhh's from friends and people when you take it out!
Positive,"Got this for a friend who will be in Africa eventually. He LOVES it, even before getting a temp phone service to use while in the US. He can Skype his wife in SA. She likes the clear picture."
Positive,"I love this phone, it's the best phone I ever own and I recommend it to my friends and they already bought three of the phones, this is a much better phone that the I phone I had. excellent product."
Positive,Good product meet my demand i loc it i wll dedinately recommend it to friends. I got it on time and it works fine
Positive,I love this phone. I can use it for all types of tasks especially for work and school. You get used to the size after a while. Note: Does not allow LTE on tmobile. But you get HSPA+ which is 4G just not lte.....i think. Overall great device I do travel out of country a bit so having phone already unlocked is a big plus.
Positive,"excellent product, what I asked was expected, a quality 100 % , quality at low cost, the finish is spectacular, I recommend this product to buyers, are you going to like, thanks ..."
Positive,I use my Samsung galaxy note 2 for both business and personal. It meets all my expectations for both. I am very pleased
Positive,Well it worked just liked they said buy a micro sim card and thats it depending on your country is 4 g or 3 g it all worksLoved everything about the phone i know its a little big but hey thats why i got it so stop hating on my choiceOpen Group Wireless was the seller and will deff buy again from them by the way i always try to go with Fulfilled by Amazon if not i always get trouble but all my accessories were for the usa version so Im happy
Positive,"I've had my galaxy note 2 for about a week now (sent from Blutekusa of Amazon). It was challenging at first because there was so much to learn and take in. But after going through all the settings and customizing everything to suit my needs, this phablet works beyond expectation. I'm loving it increasingly and it's well worth the money spent.The functionality of it is like no other. Installing and uninstalling apps is super fast and simple. I love that I can Google voice or S voice to call, text, look up stuff, schedule appts on my calendar, send myself memos and reminders, set alarms/timers, etc. without having to type anything down. I love that I can use 2 screens at once. The camera takes beautiful pictures, I was at the art museum a few days ago and the pictures turned out picture perfect. I can simply say 'cheese' or other words and it takes the picture, very awesome. Using the S note and S pen is also very fun and allows me to be creative. The possibilities are endless with this amazing device. I'm very content! I hope to have this for a very long time.The battery life is terrific! After using it a whole day, I'm at just the half way point when I put it on the charger.I only thing I'm disliking right now is that I can't download my picture text messages on Net10's AT&T network.but that is a network issue, not a phone issue."
Positive,"Pros -Best Phone out there.. Hands down.5.5"" of awesomeness.Cons -Folks with small hands might struggle to use the device."
Positive,"This phone is amazing. The size of the phone is daunting to some people, but I am a very large man so it fits perfectly in my hand. My wife and I both bought one and she loves her's as well."
Positive,"this is the best cell phone ever, an amazing big screen and i it s truly unlocked so dont have to worry to be attach to a plan."
Positive,"keep up the good job....is very professional , on time as presume ,TechGiant ,,,you are the best May God Bless you guys ..."
Positive,"Dear Jupiter Sellers,I purchased this phone from you from US Amazon in April 2013. The Amazon description did not explain that it's an international phone with NO US WARRANTY that can only be serviced by a UK Samsung Center. This is deceptive; if you are going to sell phones to US customers, you should explain if they do not have a US warranty. The SIM tray just broke and the phone is not working. Samsung is requiring me to call their UK service center to arrange for service. However because I do not have a working phone, I cannot make an international call! They do not give an option to arrange for this service over email or calling a US affiliate.I would be grateful if you could please contact me to offer to call Samsung UK at 0121 643 7373 to book this purchase for repair, in which case I would delete this negative review."
Positive,"Absolutely the best phone I have bought to date. It has a good camera and the battery life is great, I can get through at least 2 days without a recharge.Pros: large screen and S-penCons: NoneI definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a new phone with all the bells and whistles."
Positive,"Excelente cell I'm so glad, nice video quality, super processor velocity, good dimension, all than I want in a Cellphone"
Positive,"Can't say enough, is most awesome phone I ever had bar none, love it! Everything works so well, so responsive and productive I can't put it down. The technology has FINALLY acheaved its goal. A smartphone that is smart and actually works on all levels. A real keeper."
Positive,haven't had a problem since i bought the phone. I recommend this phone to any one that like a phone that can do anything
Positive,"I love this phone, and couldn't see myself using any other phone as of writing this. Its fast, sleek, the stylus is a must have feature for those who need to write things down while taking a phone call. For starters I do not have any issues with my phone right now. But I did purchase a OEM Samsung HDMI connector. The device did not work. So I called Samsung USA. I understand this is an International phone, but I bought it on Amazon in the USA. It has the Samsung name it should be supported anywhere Samsung has tech support. So I called Samsung USA, and they said I have to call Samsung UK. As they have no knowledge of the international version. So Samsung is saying they don't know their product if its an international version. Ridiculous. That will cost me money calling long distance. That is unacceptable. I have recommended Samsung numerous times. But this has changed my mind about recommending and or purchasing Samsung products in the future."
Positive,"There's no reason to even think of buying another phone this is the one, its got everything you want and more!!Screen, battery life, multitasking wow I so Amazed"
Positive,"Big screen, amazing hardware and very nice software!I am very satisfied with my purchase, the phone is fast, amazing screen! tons of features that makes you life simple and on top of that a battery that last up to 2 days of use."
Positive,"The best phone that I‚Äôve ever had!!! It does all the things that I need and some more, only a couple of things on the downside one is that after being an Iphone user for many years it‚Äôs a bit hard to learn how this one works (mainly because it has so many options that the Iphone didn‚Äôt, which is great because let‚Äôs you personalize your phone and your experience with it to a level no Iphone could) the other thing, at least for me is the S pen it‚Äôs also a bit hard to understand how does it work and what you can or can‚Äôt do with it. Everything else is on the upside, the size of the screen, the ability to use it as a flash drive, download programs on the go and then when you get home you can install them in your computer, and many many other things I may be forgetting right now, but for me it was a great change from the too restrictive Iphone/Itunes nightmare to a more friendly Android."
Positive,"As someone who has had every iphone sinse the first one, this is my first android based phone and while there are many actions that take more steps to complete the galaxy note 2 is a very goid embassador of the android family..."
Positive,What This phone can't do? .......It can't walk and thats about it! if you are thinking of getting one stop thinking and go for it!
Positive,This thing is a monster in terms of specs..SAMSUNG you nailed it again. My wife has an Iphone5 and yet she envy on this machine when i am with it for hours yet not draining the batteries..This thing is truly invented for humans...
Positive,The phone is all I have always wanted in a phone I particularly like the size which allows me to use the phone without wearing a pair of glasses. It has all that I want and even more. Im taking my time in exploring it so that I can maximize its use.I will recommend it to anyone that wants a phone -tablet because that is what it is.
Positive,"First, let me say I was nervous purchasing a mobile phone online without the hand-holding that a brick and mortar store provides. However, I was so over the killer bills from my carrier every month, I was willing to buy unlocked and go to another carrier who would maximize my use and minimize my cost.In purchasing, I was pleased by Worldwide Distributors, which is backed by Amazon. I felt the risk was worth it. The phone arrived on time, in perfect condition, and was clearly new and unused. Relief! Now, to the product...I live in a family of iPhone users- I'm a Mac computer lover, but have veered off the Mac path for mobile phones. Have had several Blackberry's, a Droid Global 2, and most recently a BB 9930 which I loved for its keyboard, security and ease of use, but the screen is quite small.Enter Samsung Note 2, simply the best phone I've ever had. I was worried that I would struggle to learn it, as I'm no tech geek... but I was amazed at how simple it was to learn. (I was so worried, that I kept my other phone and number, figuring it would take a good month to get the hang of the Note 2. Because of the urgency of my being accessible by phone for emails and calls, I did not want to take any chances.) BUT- guess what? I ported my number over the.very.next.day- I had learned the phone in a few hours!Ease of use, A.Although it may seem large for some, it is truly a marriage of a phone and a tablet! I now can see traveling without my heavy Mac laptop- this puppy can do it all. With available keyboard and multifunction dock, this is truly a break-through device. I never listened to much music on my previous phones, or watched video- why bother? The screens on prior devices were teensy and the sound quality not-so-great. I am AMAZED at the sound quality of this phone, just from the stock headphones that come with it! The screen is a perfect size for viewing anything- no more having to zoom in. The ability to hand-write notes, cut and paste, draw, etc. is incredible. I have not gotten into all that the S pen can do, but there are so many possibilities...The quality of the screen is A+, very clear, and although someone had suggested in a review somewhere to use movie mode for good color saturation, I kept the standard mode. The screen is perfect for viewing TV and movies. It is absolutely (to me, anyway,) the best of all worlds. There are so many wonderful personal adjustments that can be made, it feels like a phone that is more EASILY customizable than any mobile I've owned.Have found no drawbacks yet- have only had it up and running for three days, so will be back should I have any problems with it.Honestly, I love this phone- and yes, I'd marry it! :)"
Positive,"I have had this phone for a month already, and I can say that I am still discovering new features I didn't know it had... Even after watching tutorial videos I still find new things.Iphone 5? You can't compare that to the Note 2. It would be like comparing a BMW 335i to a Bentley Continental Supersports.If you are looking for a phone, get this one.Update 07/10/2013Unfortunately my phone suffers of the SDS (sudden death syndrome) and it freezes and crashes like 5-6 times every day... this is getting very frustrating since I spent almost $700 on this phone just 8 months ago. I never rooted or did anything you are not supposed to do with this phone. I made some research about this problem and it appears like lots of other Note IIs and Samsung Galaxy S IIIs suffer from this same problem. I wish I could get a replacement or my money back, things like this happening to such High-end (expensive) phone is plain ridiculous. I am very disappointed with you Samsung! I hope I am contacted my someone.Thank you.Update 07/13/2013This is completely unacceptable!!! This phone now freezes as soon as I reboot it when trying to unfreeze it!!! This is my second bad experience with ""high end"" Samsung devices!!! I will never buy from Samsung again, sorry but you lost a very good LOYAL (bought several big screen TVs, a sound bar and mobile devices all the time) customer because of this awful experience with devices I payed for $685 (Note II) and $630 (Galaxy Tab 10.1 that had very bad screen problems.I hope at least anyone in here takes the time to contact me."
Positive,"How fast is this phone? Ridiculously fast. How cool is this phone? Plus-ultra-chic. How good is the handwriting interface? Okay, it drops in a lot more capital letTers than iT should. But if you watch the options above the scratchpad you can fix flaws with a quick tap. And it is freaky fast reading my chicken scratches. Did I mention this phone is fast?Other folks can tell you about the specs for this phone and how it compares to that fruit company's phones and the other Androids. For me it is all about usability and this is the ultimate in my experience. There is a reason the fruit folks have sued Samsung - they cannot compete in quality/value. Between the Note and the S III, Oppa Samsung is kicking it Gangnam style. I should mention I have had a fruity phone - truly don't miss it. Best of all, no iTunes. Relief! Amazon MP3 and Kindle Apps are my new best friends.And if someone gives you guff about how big it is, fire up Netflix and show them about any movie. After they go quiet tell them ""Yeah, size matters.""I have no trouble remotely logging into a server and doing a few quick tasks. Remote mouse clicks are slick with the stylus. Reading a book is a pleasure. Short Emails are no trouble. Browsing the Web is very doable. I can turn my notebook off for days and not miss it.Works well with T-Mobile. T-Mobile worked well with me. I wandered into one of their stores, had a micro SIM card and a working phone in less than ten minutes. If you're already on Android then switching to a new Android phone is completely lacking in any pain whatsoever. If it does hurt then you're doing it wrong.Okay, this phone is not for everyone, but if you think you could use an Android on Steroids, don't hesitate."
Positive,"I bought this phone a month ago and loved the screen size(even though my hands are tiny). The Super AMOLED HD screen brings the movies to life. Its like watching on those Jumbotrons in Times Square. More like a portable Jumbotron. The colors just instantly pop off the screen with some adjustments. Just turn the 'outdoor viewing' setting ON in the video settings and the colors get supersaturated. Also works with pictures. And battery life is outstanding, only problem is it puts a little weight on it(but all batteries do). The speaker is loud and vibrant which is awesome but its located at the bottom, which sounds a bit uneven when watching a movie. But overall this phone is a beast. I recommend watching a movie with lot of color like speed racer to test out the screen.A LMFAO music video will also help. Can't wait for Galaxy Note 3 with Full HD 1080p resolution!"
Positive,"I just can't believe the change we saw on mobile phones in just less than 5 years. I started with a BB curve like 4 years ago, then I bought an iPhone 4 when it was launched and was amazed again. Then, 6 months ago I moved to Android with an N7000 that amazed me so much I had to get the new Galaxy Note II as soon as I could.And even when the N7000 is also incredible, this new version of the Note has been improved in every aspect. It's so fast, so smooth, even sexy as it feels when I hold it. Can't say nothing else but ""GET ONE ASAP""...The only problem was (until a week ago) that I had to stick to the samsung stock rom for almost a month. It's not bad but it's full of apps I don't use and drains your battery faster. But now I'm even happier since CM10 has been officially realeased for the N7100 and the phone is even faster than before and the battery lasts longer."
Positive,"a device that makes your life easier, fast and friendly in internet navigation, a lot of free and good aplications amd widgets, you get addicted to it."
Positive,Very good about reasonable price
Positive,"I love this phone! I found out about it in an article on ""cellphones for seniors."" Of course, this one was listed for those of us who are comfortable with technology. I did have a bit of a scare when I charged the phone and found it was ""speaking"" Korean but I was able to change it to English quickly. There was no problem in activating it in Peru, where I live. This is a super user-friendly phone and provides some of the features of a tablet so there is no more temptation to buy another computer-like toy that I don‚Äôt need. And the ""S"" pen makes writing messages or notes to myself very convenient - none of that ""thumbing"" out a message. I thought I would use the pen occasionally but I use it all the time because, for me, it‚Äôs quicker to write with it."
Positive,great
Positive,"Been using the phone now for about 2 weeks and am very happy with it! The screen size is a good compromise between a tablet and regular phone. Great for watching movies and reading books which is the primary reason for purchasing it! Also, the camera and video recorder is pretty impressive! Definitely happy with the phone!"
Positive,"I love this phone! I bought one of the refurbished ones at the cheapest price and it looks and performs as good as new. I know, too, because I demonstrated this model at AT&T stores when it first came out. It takes great pictures and makes great videos. I couldn't be happier with this phone!UPDATE: Seven months on and it's still working like the day I bought it. I had some problems with the S-Pen and after looking the problem up online, I decided to buy another one. The day the other one arrived, I was trying to demonstrate to someone what had happened, and the old S-Pen was working just fine and has worked fine ever since. So, now I have an extra S-Pen if I ever need it."
Positive,I absolutely love this phone...it's totally awesome. The screen size is just right not too small or too big and all the graphics are very dynamic.
Positive,"These unlocked international phones are no good I wish I would have read all the reviews before I bought the Galaxy Note 2 GT N7100 I used it for a hr it moves slow every app you open all of a sudden just crashes I emailed the seller concerning a refund she replies back that they will keep 20% of what I paid for the phone which I think is unfair I received a bogus device,,, DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PHONE!!!"
Positive,My husband loves his phone he has not had a single issue with it and it is easy to use and has all the features and programs that he needed.
Positive,Its a nice phone to have but I got my phone with a crack in the screen...but other then that um very happy with my phone
Positive,"When you get the Note 2 out of its box, your first reaction will be to its enormous size!But honestly, it's not a problem. It will fit in your jeans pocket, assuming your jeans aren't too tight, and you won't really notice its extra weight.Some will find it absurd, but those who want a big screen with loads of beautiful detail, a much better battery and some cool pen features will ""get"" it within 10 minutes of holding it for the first time."
Positive,lo maximo. el mejor telefono tablet que he tenido! sin duda alguna por ahora nada se le compara!! vale la pena comprar un equipo de estos!
Positive,"Before I bought this I was wondering whether to get a tablet and keep my current phone (Samsung Galaxy S II) with it. However, after reading several reviews and watching hours of reviews on you tube, I realized that this is the perfect device with capabilities of a phone with almost the size of a tablet. As a college student, I think this phone + tablet helps me to keep up with current news, my schedule, taking notes (thanks to the S-Pen), and really good multimedia features. I bought the device about 20 days ago and it arrived on time. Below I have listed some pros and cons of the device, according to my personal knowledge and experience.Pros:Call Quality is very good5.55"" Super Amoled ScreenS-PenQuad-core Processor with 2GB RamBattery lasts easily a day at leastLED Notification lightPhysical Home key buttonGood quality speakerRemovable batteryExpandable storage optionsCons:The screen quality could be a bit better because the screen is one of the main features (selling points) of this device.I realize Samsung makes most of their phones with plastic, as was the case with the SII, however, it might be time to change the material to something more appealing to the consumers.Software:The device comes out of the box with Android 4.1, and then I had an update to 4.1.1 which added the multitasking feature.Overall, the Android experience has become much smoother. (coming from the SII's Gingerbread and Ice Cream Sandwich)Google Now is much better than S-Voice.Samsung has created one of the smoothest & fastest phones on the market as of now by combining Android software with amazing hardware.Confusions regarding this device:LTE - The international version of this device does not have LTE capabilities. However, if you were to get it under contract from AT&T, Verizon, or U.S Cellular, then you will get LTE capabilities.Home Button Lag - There seems to be a slight lag when you press the home button. This is because, by default, the phone is expecting the user to press it again to access the S-Voice feature. The S-Voice has come a long way, but personally, I prefer Google Now. So the way to fix this lag is by----Go to Apps---Select ""S-Voice""----Click menu button---Select Settings---then De-select ""Open via the Home key"" option. And the lag should be gone now.Capacitive button light duration - The phone by default has the capacitive light duration at either 1.5 seconds or 6 seconds. However, if you are having a hard time locating these buttons without the light, you can always change the setting under Settings---Display---""Touch key light duration""--then select the option you prefer.Updates - The updates are directly handled by Google and Samsung. So there is no carrier interference here. Since the Google updates their Nexus devices right away when there is an update available, I expect the unlocked version to be updated shortly after them. May be a month or two at the most. However, the carrier versions of this phone may take several months to an year or more to get updates. (Speaking from personal experience with AT&T SII update from Gingerbread to ICS)Personal Experience:Personally, I would recommend this phone to anyone who doesn't mind the huge screen size, and the inability to do some one handed tasks. However, the pros for this device far outweigh the minor cons. Most importantly, the device makes really good quality calls and there is no issues with that (AT&T service). One of the highlights of the phone is its battery. After I unplugged it at 7 am at 100%, then I used the phone for several calls, hundreds of texts, some you tube videos, about an hour of web browsing, played several games, Wi-Fi was on, and the screen brightness at medium, when I came back home at about 7pm, the phone still had about 70% charge remaining."
Positive,"This may be the last smartphone that I may need. I have my own business, and before I had to travel with my laptop and or tablet. All I need now is my Samsung Galaxy Note 2. It can handle my spreadsheets, help me edit drawings and pictures. I have the wallet looking case that houses the unit. So now my credit card, driver's license, business cards are all together with my phone. Love it. Also, switched to a new provider by the name of SOLAVEI. Their service is $49 per month. That is for no contract, unlimited service on the T-Mobile network. They are customer driven. You actually get $20 back each month for every three members you get to enroll. So if you enroll 9 members you will get back $60 each month from Solavei. They're relying on the members to utilized their social network to advertise. Check them out at [...]"
Positive,"This is by far the best phone on the market.I had high expectations but it still blew my mind.It's large enough to do whatever a tablet can, but it will still fit in your pocket."
Positive,The best phone i have ever had! I wish it could be a little cheaper but otherwise the best of the best so far!
Positive,I love this phone and its a good one for bein unlocked so its a good product I say buy it
Positive,Very Very Very good Thank you very much a pleasure hope to deal with you again the best of the west.
Positive,good
Positive,Bought the Galaxy Note II for international usage and for connectivity in States. This phone meets my expectations in that respect. The only drawback is the size. It is a bit awkward to carry. But I will get used to it I'm sure.
Positive,Ive used this for about 3 years. Dropped it so many times without cracking it. It is more than just what it shows on its specs and function list.
Positive,üòÄ
Positive,Would not work in Belize even tho I purchased it unlocked
Positive,I've enjoyed this phone and continue to enjoy it. It will take me several months to learn how to use all the features.
Positive,Great device.
Positive,"This phone itself is amazing and beautiful but because of some baseband restrictions on the international version you can only get Edge(1g-2g) speeds on Tmobile's network which renders the phone pretty much useless. Steer clear if you plan on using this on T-mobile's gsm network. Also, on ATT you can only get 3g speeds. Forewarned. I wish I had known before I ordered one. Thankfully amazon's return policy rocks."
Positive,I bought 5 of these phones on behalf of someone else. I have now talked with them and they really liked the phones. All the users are happy and the transaction was very easy. I will be doing more business with Amazon in the future.
Positive,Best phone ever. Fast . Sharp images. Multitasking friendly use. You can carry your office in your pocket. I recomend this phone 100%.
Positive,"The phone that was described on e site was nothing at all like I was expecting. The delivery and packaging were he only good things about this phone. I had purchased this phone full retail price minus gift card and shipping hoping that I could use the factory unlocked phone on my cellular network. Wanted the option of not having to extend my contract and hopefully use the phone somewhere else if needed. I didn't know the phone could only be used internationally, at least that's what I was told when I took it up to Verizon hoping they could activate the phone for me. But there was no ESN number in the phone and SIM card would not register the phone. Do not buy unless you fully research this phone which was a mistake on my part. I will say I have purchased the note through Verizon and its one of the best phones out there, way better than the iPhone 5."
Positive,"This phone is by far the best phone/tablet on the planet today! If you have the money and you want only the best phone, this is it! I have the iphone 5 and is and excellent phone but the galaxy is in another level is simple the best of the best."
Positive,"I've had the GT-N7100 (international version of the Samsung Galaxy Note 2) since the end of last November and for awhile I was really happy with it. Great screen, nice interaction, nice features, etc - until it just randomly stopped working one day. I was using it, then when I went to turn on the screen the next time, it just would not turn on and no sign of life except for a slowly flashing red LED. After doing some online search, I then discovered that this was apparently a common problem on the note 2 and, it would appear, also on the s3. I've NEVER had a phone (or any other electronic device, for that matter) die and not turn on again out of the blue, no warning or indication of problems whatsoever. I've tried all sorts of fixes suggested by different online forums, but no luck (I am an electrical engineer by training and know a few things about electronics... and no, I had not rooted the phone or done anything unusual to it.) Now I have a $600 brick!This, by itself, negates any positives of the phone. To top it off - Samsung does NOT service non-US versions of the phone in the US. I must contact a UK service support tech (on my own dime, and being 8 hours ahead of my time, does not give me a lot of call window) to see if they can do something with it. That pretty much means most of the unlocked Galaxy Note 2s you get in the US cannot be serviced in the US. Oh, and the 2 US service support techs I spoke with basically didn't care.This support policy by Samsung is pathetic and unacceptable, especially in view of how much they charge for these things! I will never buy another Samsung again, that is for sure!"
Positive,I had my phone for 6 months and it just died. When you buy an international phone it most likely will not be with a warranty. I have tried to get warranty service with no luck. Do your research and check it out. If you are going to buy I would strongly suggest insurance for the phone.
Positive,"Sikh Sikh Sikh, simply the best and such a Sikh phone, so Sikh!! Heart and kisses from the misses. I love this phone with all my heart and soul, yes I do"
Positive,The phone is excellent. I have not been able to use most of the possibilities that this smart phone provides.
Positive,i love this phone. it can do anything i cant possiby imagine how they are evergonna improve on this device
Positive,Great phone everything i always wanted from a computer right here in the palm of my hand.Now that is power.
Positive,100% recomendado very good
Positive,Was great while it lasted. Had it for several months.One drop on a regular floor in my house and it was done!
Positive,"Excellent, fast shipping"
Positive,My first samsung phone. Still have it.
Positive,"This can serve as the greatest secondary or spare mobile device ever. For the price, it is unparalleled. It still gives you 99% of all features found in the latest version at a fraction of the cost."
Positive,I love this phone I have had it for two years it works great with my micro Sim card I also ordered online
Positive,working very very good I love it
Positive,It was very awesome. I love it. Please try once everybody
Positive,Great phone
Positive,"The phone has an IMEI # different with the number in system, so it is not working. That means the phone is BLACKLISTED."
Positive,"awesome phone works on Costa Rica (ICE), no connection drops or anything performs beastly with any game or app so far"
Positive,"Hi, my phone only works for one year, works very well , but few days ago the mother board broke, is call the Sudden Death Syndrome. So I spend a lot of money for one year of use ... Bad ... so bad ..."
Positive,The ad does not suggest that this phone can only be registered in australia and if you use it in US you would receive no authorised customer service.So if anything goes wrong with the phone after you purchase there would be no place where you can get it service here in the US.The ad does not mention this.Then if you return it you are charged a minimum of 15% stocking fee.This is fraud.
Positive,"The Smartphone is excellent. It is practical and ideal for table functions and phone. Recommended. It is comfortable, with beautiful design and works perfectly in Venezuela."
Positive,I loved Samsung Galaxy Note II and it's way better than Galaxy S3 .. Big but amazing and great S Pen .. Can't live without it
Positive,"Unlocked phone distributed by Wireless Everything was from a foreign source and on a ""lost or stolen"" list, per Consumer Cellular. Instructions were in French (I'm In Reno). Power adapter didn't work. Samsung does not support international phones, which are unlocked but don't conform to U.S. specs. Had a problem with notification ring, couldn't get help. Will return it."
Positive,"I had an S3. Bought a Note. I realized that I miss some of the S3 functionality in the Note. The Note 2 is a merge of the best of both devices. If you're thinking about getting an S3 or the Note 2, get the Note 2. Get a bluetooth ear piece if using the Note 2 bothers you. Doesn't bother me at all."
Positive,"This phone is literally the best phone in existence, with twice the battery of the Iphone, a quad core 1.6GHz exynos 4 processor, 2GB of ram, an amazing non-pentile 720p super amoled display, and the newest flavor of android(jelly bean). This phone is not as big as you might think, I actually wish it was about an inch bigger but I have huge hands. The build quality is nice and feel solid despite its plastic composition. The gorilla glass on the screen is very hard and has resisted scratches from falls to concrete (a couple feet on accident). Overall, this is the best phone money can buy so I hope you enjoy it."
Positive,"Nice. One of the best smarthphones on the market.I dont think a person with small hands would enjoy this phone. I do think, for comfort, you usually end up using two hands to handle this phone. Very responsive, beautiful screen. With google play, the apps are endless. Plus, there are many third party apps, that I did not know about until I got this phone. Samsung, itself, has an app store.Surprisingly, the S pen has come in handy. I did not think I would be using it, yet I have found that it is useful and feels natural when you write.Speaker is loud.CPU is very powerful, I have played two youtube videos at the same time and they both played smoothly. How I did this? Well, with this phone, one can have two apps on the screen; split screen. So I opened up the youtube app, and through google chrome went to the youtube website; I had two different videos playing simultaneously. Kind of dumb, because they are both playing out of the same speaker, but still, this demonstrates just how powerful it is.Overall, I am very happy with my purchase, and can see that a lot of people will be jealous when I pull this beast out :)"
Positive,Realmente es un tremendo telefono lo recomiendo a las persinas que le gusta lo bueno y lo maximo en tecnologia
Positive,"It was just what I thought, I think I will keep it for a loooooooooong time! I think I'm in love!"
Positive,"Fantastic phone! Love the fact that it gets all the Updates immediately, rather than waiting for US carriers! No bloatware and works perfectly with StraightTalk with AT&T sim (also from StraightTalk). Blows my brother's SGSIII away :) !!! I was leery about about 3rd-party seller (my paranoia), even though the sale happens through Amazon, but everything worked out great."
Positive,"This phone is fast. I held off on responding for 3 months since I received this. I did this for a couple of reasons. 1) It is big and 2) I didn't have experience with the Jelly Bean Android OS.1) Big Phone - this phone works great and fits in my front pocket.2) The OS works great.3) The Battery - If you keep bluetooth, GPS, and Wi-fi on all day long, your battery won't last you with any phone. I set the phone on battery saver mode. If I don't stream radio all day, I can get two days of use out of this phone. I also don't talk on the phone all day. I use this for 3 to 4 calls a day. I purchased this mainly to stay connected with my emails.I would certainly recommend this phone to anyone. Get a 64GB microSDXC chip. I have used my phone to store files many times."
Positive,The phone I received will only work on ATT Networks... I could not get my Verizon SIM card to work and neither could Verizon Tech Support. The phone was set to recognize ATT networks only. I had to return it.
Positive,"The best smartphone in the world. I love this gadget, the S pen is perfect, everything works just fine. very satisfied"
Positive,"Although a fun of Samsung Galaxy, I initially did not want to buy this because I already had the S2. Hey that was wrong, Note 2 is simply amazing. Does all the stuff you need in a phone"
Positive,Love this phone. Big screen easy to use has everything you would need. Camera produces sharp pictures love the front and back camera Is it big but this is the phone I wanted Everyone is very jealous
Positive,"I gave it a 5 because its the best phone i ever owned, and I also own a i-phone. I appreciate the bigger screen for browsing and watching movies. Still learning about all the cool things this phone can do, only problem is that i can't put it down and my wife complains about me spending too much time on the phone."
Positive,The Phone looked great and was in very good condition. I have loved every single second spent with this phone and now I'm just worried because I think Samsung just set the phone bar way too high and it'll be hard for me to use any other phone after this one.
Positive,"There is nothing to say about this phoneIt's extraordinary legendary awesome.If you are thinking to get a new smartphone, you are in the right place.You must have it, believe me"
Positive,"After 8 years with Blackberry and a couple knowing that I had to change to another operating system, this was the best decision I could have made...!"
Positive,I bought a fake one before this one. I was angry and disappointed before this one was delivered. This one is what I want! I really love it and recommend to buy.
Positive,"This was bought as an upgrade to my Galaxy Note. The phone arrived on time and I love it. I had some initial issues with the s-pen being overly sensitive but I fixed it by opening it up and adjusting the potentiometer. Apart from that, I'm enjoying using this great phone."
Positive,This phone is ultra fast.Great for browsing internetComes with good instructions for major functions andNote 2 specific features the first time you turn the phone on Cons: not many accessories avalible so farThis is not glass and metal case like iphone.This is just plastic but the screen is glass
Positive,"i was looking this phone and the galaxy S3 however the lack of only 1gb ram on the S3 leaned me toward this baby im good with the size its actually a lot bigger than my bold 9790 but didnt have problems with it. its blazing fast comes unlocked to work with any carrier and its a beauty, what else do u want?"
Positive,"This is a great phone. I've never liked the touchscreen phones because as I type a lot and have big fingers, I always ended up misspelling words. The bigger screen of the Note II makes typing much easier, and if I want extra accuracy I can use the S-Pen. About the other features, I guess the other reviewers have covered them pretty well. Buy it, you won't regret it."
Positive,I only rated this product 5 stars because that's all that is allowed....awesome device...great screen...fast processing....ultra handy s-pen....just a fantastic all round device
Positive,"This phone is Amazing, I used to have iphone 5 but when I changed to this phone the note 2 its just awesome"
Positive,", i just order the samsung galaaxy note 2 , im waiting for it to come , im really loooking forward seeing this phone , icant wait :)"
Positive,The list of amazing is WAY too long to type! You will LOVE this phone! See also my review on Samsung Galaxy Note II N7100 Unlocked GSM International Version White
Positive,I bought this 3 years ago and it is still going strong.
Positive,"I absolutely HATE THIS. I love the phone itself and all of it's features, but it uses AT&T towers and it keeps dropping my calls. When I am in my office I only get 1 bar. I was in Albertson's last night and I could not even get 1 bar."
Positive,My husband is still using this phone and loves it.
Positive,Thanks!
Positive,I purchased this phone and it's was locked with at and t
Positive,very good product as described by the seller
Positive,im satisfied with my new phone the package is ok
Positive,Excelent. Thanks!
Positive,Are you kidding? Samsung is the new Sony.
Positive,Stopped working 3 months after purchasing it. Will not recommend.
Positive,"I choose to give it a 5 stars because the end product is what I expected it to be. I had to print out the user's manual just to figure out all the bells and whistles on this phone/tablet. It would be great if they added a DVD with the phone and demonstrate each particular features and how to use it. The only negative side of this would be the cheap plastic enclosure on the back. If that was made with something like aluminum, that would of been even better."
Positive,"First off, let me just say that this phone is incredible. The screen is huge and vibrant, the S-pen is amazingly functional, and it's the perfect size. Just small enough to fit in the pocket, and just big enough to provide the added benefit of a larger screen. There are other reviews describing how awesome this phone is, so I'll let them do most of the talking.I specifically wanted to write this review just to let everybody know that this phone is GSM-based, which means they use a SIM card and ARE NOT COMPATIBLE WITH VERIZON OR SPRINT. Verizon and Sprint use CDMA-based phones, while AT&T and T-Mobile use the older style of GSM. So if you're planning on buying this phone and connecting it to Verizon or Sprint, it will not work. Don't purchase it!I purchased one in ignorance of this fact and had to return it. Luckily, Amazon customer service was superb as usual and I had no issues returning it and getting a refund.I hope this helps!"
Positive,"First time around I bought this phone on random selection for the Seller. According to the title of this phone it's Factory Unlocked, it is not specified as an international model in the title or the description. Only way to know that it is international is by researching the model number or looking more closely at what each individual seller description is.The first phone I got was from FGS Trading, I didn't know it was international until after I received the phone and when it turned on, it was in Mandarin. I had to google and youtube a video in order to walk me through setting the phone into English, imagine the hassle. I contacted this Seller about the issue, also that the phone was not syncing with my computer because the ID Hardware was not identifiable. The Seller refused to take back the phone without charging me extra and finally after almost 2 months of debating the issue with the seller, through Amazon's A-to-Z Claim I ended up getting a full refund. Tom is the name of the customer service agent from FGS who I spoke to and demonstrated over the exchange of 30 + emails that he clearly is not fit for customer service. For him, his company is always right and I was the airhead who didn't do my research into this phone.THE SELLER does not follow their 100% money back guarantee unless they are forced to and their customer service is lacking, if they were competent it would not have taken nearly 2 months to resolve the issue. This seller also does not offer return labels for the assurance that an item can be shipped back to them, they only provide an address. You have to pay for your own shipping, insurance and signature on the package just to make sure the Seller gets back their phone. **Buyer beware, if you purchase an international model SAMSUNG USA will not cover this phone under their warranties. In order for me to get any service on this phone I would have had to send it all the way back to Hong Kong. The Seller does not provide you with this information. All they cared about and clearly demonstrated was that they got their money so they no longer need you or positive feedback. In one of the email exchanges from the Sellers' agent, he told me that MOST CONSUMERS KNOW this phone is international and that they are happy with the phone they received and since I am unhappy/unsatisfied/clueless its my own fault because I did not do my research. Does that mean that those who posted similar reviews are clueless as well??? :(Now here's the kicker, I re-purchased this phone because I have wanted it for a really long time, BUT since I did not want to run into the same problem, I did my purchase with Amazon customer service on the phone. Now, the Amazon agent was not aware that this phone was international either. World Wide Distribuitors did not have it labeled or specified as an international phone. I re-bought the phone only because it was assumed to be US Coded. The Amazon agent advised me that it was, otherwise the Seller must disclose that it is international.BOY!! were we wrong... I did not find out this phone was international until it was already in transit to me. The seller finally responded to my inquires 3 days after I made my purchase to inform me it was international. I immediately contacted the Seller by phone and the customer service person- Juan, who I spoke to was very nice. He told me to simply refuse the package. Aslong as the item remained unopened/unused and still in its original factory shipped form I would get a full refund.I followed his instructions and anticipated a full refund minus the shipping fee I paid. That did not happen. Upon my second phone contact with the seller, the first agent was not helpful, he informed me that I was subject to a restocking and a return shipping fee. At this point I requested to speak to a supervisor to justify why I was receiving two sets of information and how it was even LEGAL for the Seller to charge those fees.The supervisors name was Melissa, she was definatley NOT helpful. In fact, this person was unprofessional, rude and very condescending. Melissa informed me 1) my product was subject to a restocking fee and since the item was returned I would have to pay for that cost as well, 2) I could not contest it because it was a company policy clearly listed on Amazon's website and 3) Even if I filed an A-to-Z claim it would be denied immediately because the policies they have are all Amazon pre-approved. This person was snarky, rude and beyond tolerable. Melissa even refused to give me any company information in order to file a BBB claim. When I told them I would take the matter back to Amazon, she told me she would be happy to transfer me to Amazon customer service so that I can hear Amazon tell me that my refund request would be denied since I obviously needed to hear it from two sources.Two weeks have gone by since my purchase from World Wide and Amazon granted me a full refund since I refused this package. Amazon also gave me a promotional gift in the amount of the original shipping fee for the trouble I have encountered with the Seller. I have also submitted a BBB claim against this Seller and my complaint can be viewed publicly. So I suppose, in the end, Melissa, if you see this post, you were wrong.It's a shame really. I have wanted this phone for a long time and finally saved up enough to get it. Times are hard, cash is not expendable for most consumers and this purchase was a luxury item purchase for me. I never expected to get so much trouble. When I did have the phone, it was a wonderful experience since I had never had something before that could do so much. It played movies, music, took wonderful pictures, writing instead of using the qwerty board to text was awesome. I really love this phone but I will not sign a contract to have it :(.... Too bad that all the factory unlocked are international models."
Positive,"The product matched the specifications, and arrived on time. About the Samsung Note 2 itself, it's my upgrade from samsung galaxy Note N7000. Big improvement in battery performance and speed, better, stylus design, now with led notification. Overall very happy with the product and the seller."
Positive,"Excellent product, a gray color very nice lead. All waited in a qualit telephone, it was not waiting except for the very light t"
Positive,"I ordered this phone. When I received it, I received that it was falsely advertised. It came in a sealed box and looked brand new, but when I checked the total memory on the phone it had 10GB is the total memory and 9.72GB was available for use because there were some preloaded apps that had use a small amount of memeory out of the 10GB. The sell ad said it had 16GB total. When I contacted the buyer, the tried to belittle my intelligence stating that they was 16GB on the phone, but the apps was taking up the 6GB of the 16GB making it 10GB left. First of all the know this difference between total GB on a cell phone and avaliable memory after some memory has been used by apps. I told them this. From the beginning, they gave me the run around for days before responding and then refused to give me a refund. Also there is something wrong with the backlight. BEWARE OF THIS BUYER, FALSE ADVERTISEMENT AND THE PRODUCT SEEM TO BE SOME DEFECTIVE CELL PHONES THAT SAMSUNG ARE SELLING TO THESE TYPE OF BUYERS JUST TO GET RID OF."
Positive,"Like many I was afraid of their size, but now I love this phone, it has everything I need and the quality is very good. They delivered on time and I am happy"
Positive,I upgraded from the Note and what a difference. The Note II has a much faster processer in it and makes a hugh difference.Still learning about all the features but I am very happy with my purchase. I was very please with the seller in getting the phone to me as fast as he did. It was getting pretty frustrating using my Note with a shattered screen. The seller did include some things I wasn't expecting and that was just a bonus.All in all it was a great experience dealing with this seller and I would gladly do it again.
Positive,excellent
Positive,Great
Positive,Everything I wanted in my note 2!
Positive,Awesome phone.
Positive,"Did not work in my market (Jamaica) even though it has the listed frequency. I was instructed to change the modem, which did not solve the issue"
Positive,"This is an amazing phone. I have been using it for a couple years now and am really impressed. After daily use for 2 years it still has great battery life, and can complete any task I need it to. I am very impressed with this phone. I expected to need to replace it after 2 years or so, but I currently have no plans of doing so. Samsung has earned my trust in the mobile phone business.I highly recommend this phone, or a newer version if you feel the minor upgrades are worth it.The only criticism that comes to mind is the autocorrect feature that has actually gotten worse over time."
Positive,"Great phone, works after 2 years and i am happy with"
Positive,Great n great price
Positive,"I went to T moble about this problem,they replaced sims card ,still no good,T moble gave me signal buster ,able to make calls sometime but still bad I also have a old sony ericsson phone it works great,tryed to get repairs from SURGE TELECOM THE PHONE IS ONLY UNDER WARRANTY FOR 30 DAYS"
Positive,"This is the perfect size for me; the iPhone was too small and a Mini iPad was too big. So instead of having two devices, I use this one.I purchased a used (locked to Sprint) Note 2 on Amazon from a seller that got the phone from someone else. Unbeknownst to the seller, the old owner rooted the phone with Teamwin's recovery tool. I never rooted the iPhone (never saw the point in it), so I got a crash course in rooting. After causing issues with my accounts and preventing Samsung updates, I almost gave up on this phone.As a last ditch effort, I used the rooting to my advantage; I put on Cyanogenmod's 4.3 firmware! Unlike the iPhone, rooting is worth it on an Android.Android 4.3 is very nice and the phone works even better. My only complaint is that the S-note function is no longer as polished as Samsung had designed it, but using a handwriting app it meets my needs.I don't use cellular service on this, so I don't know how the reception is. Basically, I use wifi to make calls using Talkatone and Google Voice. Between work and home, I'm rarely without wifi so why pay $80-$120 for service? All my calls work as if I had a fully functioning cell phone. Using wifi, it does not matter what the phone carrier is set as; in fact I turn off the roaming."
Positive,"I've been stuck with a broken HTC for WAY too long and upgrading to something that can even handle a higher version of Android was a pleasure to move to! The battery life is good but I still carry an external 13,000mAh external charger battery pack.Speed, features, build quality, price, size...all great!Only thing is it's not a one handed phone and so you will be annoyed before getting used to it.Note, there is no 4G radio in this model, but it goes do HSPA+ which is just as fast and unlocked means I can go between AT&T or Tmobile."
Positive,"This is an amazing phone. I like the fast internet and the screen appearance. I just bought the phone, but it came to be what i think i wanted."
Positive,I got this Samsung Galaxy note 2 in a seal broken box. Was highly disappointed with fact that phone was gray colored but the accessories were white.Clearly we got a opened piece and this is first time where I felt let down by Amazon.
Positive,You will not be disappointed with this smartphone. Very fast and does everything smoothly. Can't go wrong with the battery life which is much better than my Note 1.
Positive,"IF I COULD GIVE THIS ZERO STARS, I WOULD. I HAD READ OTHER REVIEWS AND WAS AWARE THAT SOME PEOPLE WERE GETTING THE INTERNATIONAL VERSION. WHEN I LOOKED AT THE SELLER, THEY HAD A HIGH RATING AND THE PACKAGE SHIPPED OUT OF MESQUITE, NEAR DALLAS TEXAS. SO I ORDERED THE PHONE. HOWEVER, THIS IS AN INTERNATIONAL MODEL BEING SOLD IN THE US. I THOUGHT I WAS BEING CAREFUL BY SELECTING A COMPANY THAT HAD USA IN THE NAME (BLUTEKUSA).WHEN THE PHONE ARRIVED, THERE WAS AN ADAPTER FOR THE US AND THE SEALS WERE SLICED. WHEN I OPENED IT, THE INSTRUCTIONS WERE IN SPANISH AND THE ORIGINAL PLUG WAS ONE OF THOSE INTERNATIONAL PLUGS WITH THE WEIRD CYLINDRICAL RODS. NOT HAPPY!!!!!!!!!!FORTUNATELY, AMAZON HAS A RELATIVELY HASSLE FREE RETURN POLICY. MAYBE THEY SHOULD ACTUALLY DO SOMETHING ABOUT THE FALSE ADVERTISING ON THIS PAGE..."
Positive,"Keeping it short & sweet, this phone is spectacular. I typically sidestep Samsung devices because of their less-than-stellar design and over-hyped features, but the Galaxy Note 2 is by far the best of the Samsung galaxy series. Why? Because its the only one that really aims to be different - despite having the similarly-redundant Plastic Samsung Design.Pros- S Pen: There's just nothing like it on a phone. Even if some people barely bother to use it, it is a very clever & unique feature- Oddly enough, this phone works snappy with TouchWiz UI. I'm not a huge fan of the OS but it flows nicely on the Note.- 3100mAh Replaceable Battery (One of the best phones in terms of battery life - can last all day with heavy use)- HD SUPER AMOLED Screen -- Though the screen has a resolution of 720P, it is just as vibrant as any of the other high-end 1080P phones out there. I dare you to try it out. Samsung has really done a superb job of maximizing color clarity in this phone, despite its larger size. (The best way to recognize this for yourself is to test it out. The Sony Xperia Z series phones are 1080P and have Pixel Densities over 400, yet the display seems dull looking and colors are washed out. Don't let the specs fool you, try it out for yourself!)- The onscreen keyboard is amazing. No more accidentally double-tapping or nudging other keys.** The only substantial con for some people will be its size. However, the phone fits nicely in every single one of my pants. I have no issues at all with it. Obviously, if you like to wear super-tight skinny jeans, this phone WILL NOT be for you. But if you're like me and wear relaxed-fit clothing, you will have no issues tucking this bad boy away.I definitely recommend this phone."
Positive,I have AT&T and it works great fast 4g LTE. Awesome phone love it everything is great. The shipping was fast also great job Samsung and thank you Amazon. Peace
Positive,"I won't go into all the features and details of this phone as you can obviously find that elsewhere and they are numerous. But after a week of owning the Note 2 the only complaint I have is no ""Mark All as Read"" option in the native email.I bought the Note 2 specifically for the S-Pen (*cough* Stylus), because I have large hands and most high-end smartphones have little tiny touchscreen keyboards. Not only is the screen incredibly responsive to the S-Pen, but it also does a great job converting the handwriting to text. Gone are the days of having to use special one-stroke characters to write like on older PDA's - just write something as you normally would in the text field, and use a quick right dash to space, quick left dash to backspace, a paragraph mark (like a J but starting at the top with a 90 degree angle) for a new paragraph and lots of available S-Pen gestures using the pen's button. When I do use my fingers on the keyboard, the large screen is much more accomodating for those with big hands.The reception is great especially for an Android smartphone, and everything runs fast and smooth on Android 4.1. If you want hype, go with an iPhone, but if you're looking for the best of the best in mobile devices, look no further. The hefty price tag may be daunting, but when you get your hands on it you'll be happy you made the right choice!(Entire review written on my Galaxy Note 2)"
Positive,This is the best phone I've ever had and I've had lots of them. I really like the fact that it is AT&T bloatware free and that I can truly use my phone the way it was intended to be used without a phone company telling me what I can or can not do.The shipper was quick and the phone was well packed. I am 100% satisfied with my purchase.
Positive,I bought this phone to replace my original Samsung Galaxy Note that I got last year. this phone is in everyway a big update to the original Note. I find it much easier to hold in my hand than the original Note. Overall I have found the phone's performance is stellar. I also had the Samsung Galaxy SIII and can definitely say that the Note II is a big step up (no pun intended). The stylus just adds a serious layer of icing to the cake.
Positive,This is the best phone I have ever owned. It serves more purpose than any phone I have ever owned. I have downloaded every app on it that I have ever wanted with plenty of space left for many more. The battery life is excellent. In most cases lasts for one or two full days. I couldn't be happier with any other phone.
Positive,"Ideal for taking notes - the S-Pen is a really cool feature. It's a little bit big till you get used to it, and might not fit all pockets, but it's a great piece of hardware."
Positive,"Ordered used, but only used for 1 week in perfect shape. It looked good but would not read the SIM cad installed at the ATT store. Installed a second SIM card and still would not read it. The same SIM card put into another phone worked fine. Also, was not happy with the communications with the vendor.I have since replaced it with an identical phone bought on EBay......vendor had great communications and I absolutely LOVE the phone."
Positive,this is my first super smartphone. im from Mexico and everyone will turn there heads. i went with the note 2 becuase i wanted a tablet and cell phone but why not combine the two? its a great combination. the packaging arrivied in time and in fashion and orden. no complaints about the shipping Good job Amazon. and so far the phone is working PERFECTLY!!!
Positive,"Though it doesnt have best screen resolution, however for the price and size of display it is good enough.The size of display gives enough comfort for internet browsing. Everything is as expected from a Android smartphone."
Positive,This seller (worldwide distributors) is selling phones that are (NOT) compatable to the USA...I have been having problems from day 1 and I thought I being a new user did not understand the phone and how to use it properly but as time has gone by it's gotten worse and when i contacted the seller to tell them the issues they said it was past the 30days and to contact the manufacturer because the phone is still under there warranty and they will fix it no problem. Well I did contact them and they had me read the phone's codes and they said the phone is hard wired to (Africa) so it's not hard wired to USA and that it's not under warranty because the phone is not compatable to the US and it's only gonna get worse as time goes on because the up dates will cause the phone to go out of sinc....So with neither the seller* (worldwide distributors) or (Amazon) not wanting to take responsibility and don't want to fix my phone or get me a new one that's USA made and compatable I'm warning you to stay away from this company and not do business because they will not make this right I spent $635.00 for a phone that is absolutely not very functionable or adiquite to work right. I't so frustrating that I'm gonna have to pay for another phone out of my pocket when they should fix this at it's not right f this company to sell inferior products and not USA comatable.
Positive,"Just what I wanted it to do,great I would recomend it for anyone who wants the best cell phone period!"
Positive,"This is a great phone.The screen is big enough to show all the details that it is capable of displaying and the phone is still small enough to fit in a pocket!Is is pretty potent too, no lag, no force closes no problems!"
Positive,"This phone is simply amazing. I am an AT&T customer and since this is the international version, you just need to take it for unlocking. Being the international version, you get the better processor and performance than the carrier branded version.The phone is blazingly fast and the multi-window feature is pretty nifty, although not very useful realistically, just in some rare occasions. The stylus is the most convenient feature ever in a smartphone since the color screen. It is super useful for note taking, screen captures and precise clicking on tricky pages. The other ""Samsung"" features (gesture support, air view, etc.) are all ok and useful. The screen is huge and colorful and a joy to use to watch movies and videos. Basically, this phone is a mini computer. Just to get this straight, this phone is so cool and multipurpose that I even considered buying a Bluetooth keyboard to replace my computer. No joke. You can even download torrents and use PDFs, Office files and scan and everything (with the proper apps, and I only download free apps).Structurally, the build quality looks pretty good but the phone is mostly plastic and very fragile. My HUGE critique of this phone is that without a cover, it is as slippery as a bar of soap. You HAVE to get a cover for this phone, to prevent slipperiness and to protect it from falls. I have a super cheap, brand-less, made-in-china $10 dollar plastic/rubber cover and it works like a charm. The trick is to find a cover that doesn't add to its overall thickness (I had an Otterbox for the phone and it turned it into a literal brick). The phone size without the cover is big (duh!) but it fits into jeans fine. I mostly store it in my back pocket and it only protrudes just a bit. You can also put it in front pocket and it will look and feel ok. If I am wearing thin dress pants or going out somewhere really fancy, I take the rubber cover off and take it naked (no cover) in a jacket pocket or a pants pocket and it feels fine.The only other problem I encountered was receiving text messages. The phone apparently stopped receiving text messages at least once a week (apparently a common issue for this unit), but it has not given me that problem in a quite a while (maybe an update fixed it?).Overall, this is the best phone I have ever owned. I have owned it for around 8 months now and it is still going strong. I also own a brand new Galaxy S4 by T-Mobile (for work) and my Note is still my favorite by miles.Get this phone! You will not regret it!"
Positive,"I bought this for my boyfriend's birthday. He loves it so much. It took a couple of months to learn to work all the special features, but once you take the time to do that it is incredible. Don;t buy it if you want a simple phone. Buy it is you want a phone that can do anything. It has a really big screen which is good for seeing the small stuff. I love the burst mode when you take pics."
Positive,"The phone is huge, it's not a featherweight.After about a week I felt like there is no going back to a smaller screen, it no longer even seems large to me.The S-Pen is a blessing, so much more comfortable to scribble than to type into a touch-screen, so easy to capture part of a screenshot, to take notes during a phone call.NFC is great too - never knew anything about it until i got the phone, now i use NFC tags in my car, my house my office.Batter life is so much better than any smart-phone - no way you can drain it in one day!"
Positive,"This device makes all other phones appear milliscule and absolete, also I hardly ever used my laptop anymore as im away from home 14 hrs a day and this does everything you'll ever need.. so get it as this is not just buying a phone it's an investment."
Positive,"This is a great cell phone for business, it has large screen and fast processor .price is O.K.i recommend it to the others"
Positive,Love it! Received it on time with no problems. Has been easy to learn and set up. Love writing with the Smartpen.
Positive,"Buy this phone as a present for my uncle, he spends a phone in one hand and one on the other hand. I liked a lot, its functionality and it really deserves the best punctuation, is really complete graphics are exceptional, speechless.The most complete on the market and its size is excellent and perfect for this phone. I arrive in excellent condition and new exactly as displayed, TechGiant recommend as an excellent seller"
Positive,very good
Positive,One of the best phablets I've ever had. You won't regret buying this gadget
Positive,My son loves.... uses the camera for his business... he never forgets this one..
Positive,Good
Positive,fast service and economic product
Positive,Excellent Recommended 100%
Positive,"I had a BlackBerry for a long time, but I had to pay every month for that stupid service, and it got pretty old also, so I decided to get a smart phone. Every phone I have looked at, it was nice but it didn't strike me, until one day walking in the mall they were exposing Note II, loved the design!!! Since I am not good with technology, and I don't really care about it, I was a bit concerned about me and touch screen and all that new stuff, I though it would take me months, so even though Note II sounded pretty spiffy, I still got it!!! I love the phone right now!!! I have been using it for the last 4 days, and its EASY to use, even though there are some stuff I had to look at it on videos on youtube, but in general, its EASY! I read a lot of articles, laws and media, and the screen size is good, it is a bit big when you talk on the phone, but I'm sure you'll get used to it! Love the phone!!!"
Positive,"I am using it with net 10 service and can not be happier..It is fun, efficient and super responsive. A great substitute for my lap top in easy to read/use format."
Positive,I feel this is better than Nexus. good clarity and lots of smart feature. they should provide a smart cover as Apple does.
Positive,This phone is perfect. It just fits into my pocket like a phone should but I can use the internet properly on it and so on. The s-note feature is very useful for to-do lists shopping lists etc. Screen is the best I have ever seen on a mobile phone. If you need the pen feature to make the phone practical for your uses then this is the one. If you don't plan to use the pen then maybe the s3 or s4 are big enough and will do everything that this one will. I will keep this phone for a long time.
Positive,"I bought this phone for my mom on mother's day. We have Verizon and I read the description up and down yet still never saw anything stating that it's not Verizon compatible!! Long story short, phone did come on time, didn't work at all for Verizon because Verizon specifically makes their phones a certain way so that international versions will not work, returned it, and the ""small fee"" they said was to be taken upon return was about $100!!?!?! Ridiculous!!!! Never again..."
Positive,"I use ver***n service and checked with them. They supported this model. However, when I brought my unlocked ""German"" phone into the service center. They couldn't set up my account because of software issues. The company delivered exactly what it said it would, they just didn't explain that unlocked don't mean squat."
Positive,"These have defective memory chips. These 16gb note 2 have defective memory chips that cause Samsung sudden death. Look up insane chips. Samsung will not fix it. They will not help at all. There is a company that will replace the emmc chip for $150. I've used this phone for about 8 months now and it's been very difficult to keep it working. It crashes and the screen will not come back on. Many people who purchased these 16gb gt-n7100 have had complete device failures. Samsung does not service these phones and will not help...they directed me to the Phillipines, UK, and India. The UK said they can't help because it's a USA variant....it's been a nightmare. Notice that a lot of the 5 star reviews are not labeled verified purchases..."
Positive,"I live in Venezuela, and send me a CDMA phone and does not work in my country so I lost the money, plus the phone did not bring the s pen, really I am very disappointed in this purchase"
Positive,"I Bought this phone for it to suddenly stop working with no warning. turns out the motherboard completely died on me.Good Luck getting anywhere with customer service. The US Samsung CS turned me down saying this is a UK phone. UK tells me this phone is made in the UAE, and UAE tells me that the phone is manufactured in Africa so they can't do anything. I got no where and ended up with > 600$ down the drain.Beware of this Seller and Beware of Samsung Products."
Positive,I got this phone through Amazon for the first time and was not sure if i'm going to be stuck with a lemon. It turn out this phone is new and it great.
Positive,it fits perfect and i am realy happy that I bought this product. Also I want to mension that I love it.
Positive,it is an Awesome Device i Have Had used. Thank u Samsung. everyone should Try it and go How weLL this Device is.
Positive,"I purchased two Note 2's and I must say it is the best and fastest smart phone (phablet) I have ever had the pleasure of using. People complain about the plastic body but I love it! Bought the titanium gray because the white doesn't look as premium. Phone is big but not too big as people claim but its a matter of personal opinion. My hand started to cramp up after using it for a while (lol) because..well they are small-average sized. I didn't think I would but I am liking the s-pen more and more and I am surprised to be using it at all. The screen is absolutely stunning. The screen size is just perfect at 5.5 inches. I Love the high contrast saturated colours especially when watching a full length film.Phone is very fast. Had several apps running in the background and didn't realize I left them open until i checked the task manager. Also, loving the motion gestures, yes they are gimmicks but they are very cool and most of them are useful. I could write an epistle about this phone but I won't. I DEFINITELY recommend this phone. Even though its several months old its still 1 of the best on the market and the price is very reasonable in my opinion."
Positive,Great phone to have. Letter big enough so you can see them without any problem. Screen is large enough and quality of video is excellent. So if you are looking for a excellent phone then try the note ii you will love it.
Positive,"There some troubles, however now all of them has been solved.I like this new phone.The service is good, and there is some broken in battery,and they send me a new one."
Positive,This Samsung Galaxy Note II GT-N7100 - factory unlocked- will not work on either Cincinnati Bell wireless or on Verizon Wireless.
Positive,"Simply Excellent! Great performance, Great battery, Big display and the S Pen is very useful. The phone came with an European charger, besides that the full shopping-using he product experience was flawless."
Positive,Everything I need and more. Love the large screen. Using this phone on Consumer Cellular Service and it works great! [...]
Positive,"It is simply amazing things you can do on this device and most of all for my travel, I do not have to call my provider any more. The freedom to put any countries sim.-card to make a phone call makes life easy"
Positive,"You said this was UNLOCKED for ALL carriers!!! This is NOT true. Those who do not KNOW the difference between CDMA and GSM phones, buyer BEWARE. This will ONLY work w/AT&T, T-Mobile, Boost. If you have SPRINT or VERIZON, it will NOT work....."
Positive,ok let me start by saying those negative reviews must be from people that aren't computer literate..i ordered my phone on 2/19/13 and it was at my house 2 days later so delivery time is excellent....and i need not give a review of the phone just because if i ordered the phone that must mean i like it and it arrived in one piece so i'm one happy customer no complaints fro me about the seller as they did an outstanding job getting my order to me and getting the right order to me
Positive,"Great phone, fast shipping. I will definately but this phone again. This is the best phone i have seen my entire adult life"
Positive,"This phone is simply outstanding. I have owned and used many different phones over the years and I can honestly say this one beats them all. I'm a middle aged man with weakening eyes and less dexterity than I once had so my current phone (that was a good fit just two years ago) is just to small to for me to easily see the information being displayed. I guess you could say I grew out of it. LOLI looked at the iPhones and the Galaxy SIII but neither of those had the computing power as the Galaxy Note 2. The LARGE 5.5"" screen makes it very easy to see things at a glance. I find that I don't have to zoom in on websites as often as I use to because the S-pen allows me to click on the links and buttons easier.I know this phone's developers had the younger generation in mind when they were designing it but let me tell ya, it's a wonderful tool for us older farts too (Thanks Samsung).I find it difficult to choose which features I want to comment on because I like so many of them. All I can tell you is you wont be disappointed with this phone.There is one minor thing that is worth mentioning though. When I powered my phone on for the first time everything was in Japanese. This was a bit surprising to me because the GT N7100 was suppose to be for the North American market. Now, since I don't read Japanese and my unfamiliarity of the phone I couldn't navigate to the settings to change the language to English so I had to search online for an how how-to video showing me how to get to the settings to make the appropriate changes. It took a little time to find but I managed to get it all taken care of.As usual, Amazon shipped it ahead of schedule, it arrived in three days."
Positive,"Awesome phone!This is exactly what I was looking for. A phone that I can surf the Web, and make calls.Loving the S-penLoving the sizeMust have!!"
Positive,"This phone is amazing. It does everything you spect and more!!. the size is not a problem at all... im 6ft tall, average guy and the size of the phone is not a problem."
Positive,"Well coming from Note N7000 could not get anything else... everything below 5.5"" its a downgrade.. will change it for note 3 next year around this same month..."
Positive,"Had a few problems getting the right phone to work with my carrier's SIM card, but Thrifty Computer was very diligent in making my purchase with them a satisfying one. And in the end, after returning two phones, (@ no cost to me), I have a phone that I am very satisfied with.I was leary at first about how the seller would correct the initial problem, if at all, but my worries were put to rest immediately, as my emails were responded to promptly. I would absolutely recommend them to others, and would certainly use them again myself if the need ever arises."
Positive,This smartphone has served me well for the past two years. I love it. Even though I have a Note 4 I still have not part with it.my trusted Note 2. Great smartphone.
Positive,Great product. I accidently ordered this not realizing it was the wrong band though so I had to return it!
Positive,If you looking at this your at least considering this phone. Do it!! This phone is amazing. The only concern I had at first was the size. After 15 minutes I was used to it. Now I feel that my iphone is tiny. My friends who have an iphone 5 when I pick it up I'm like where did you get this little tiny baby phone?? lolOverall great experience. I put the extra money into getting the factory unlocked and I don't regret it. Not only do you get the updates directly from Samsung you also have a carrier logo free phone. Looks clean!
Positive,"I got this product as my Christmas gift for my husband. He loves gadgets and i know he wanted to have this phone. When he received it he couldn't stop playing with it. the screen is so big, a lot of features, very responsive and we both love the voice commands. the only minor downside is the manual that comes with the product it is in Polish i think but other than that everything is cool! I'll update this review after a month or so."
Positive,"This is the first time I ever write a review about a product. I just couldn't let everyone know how happy I am to have bought this device. Simply put, it is perfect.I now have no limitations when browsing the web. Sometimes some websites will send you to the mobile version of it which comes with some setbacks. Not on this phone. I access the desktop version of any web site and it works great. It plays the videos, open files, let you login and more. The screen is great for reading. The picture and video are high quality even under low light conditions.This device has replaced my previous cell, my camera, video camera, mp3 player and my laptop.I had some concerns about the size but after about a month using it, it all vanished. The phone fits even in my skinny jeans pockets.All my colleagues are impress about the performance of this device. They like challenging what it can do and so far, no matter how hard they have tried, they have not found something the Note 2 can't do.I am highly satisfied with my purchase. The only problem is that my wife now wants one!"
Positive,Hope it keeps trucking along for 2 years! I love the large screen and it does fit in my pocket.....~ GREAT PHONE
Positive,The phone is everything I had hoped it would be. Have to charge the battery every day however and I don't often use streaming content. Just phone and minimal internet.
Positive,"I purchased a Samsung Galaxy Note II GT-N7100 unlocked international phone on August 2, 2013 from TechGiant and fulfilled by AMAZON.Today, October 17, 2013, it has stopped working. When I power up my phone, it displays the banner screen ('Samsung Galaxy Note II GT-N7100') repeatedly forever. When I removed the battery and put it back into the phone. The same thing happens again.I contacted Samsung USA and they told me that they will not support the phone because it was made in the UK and they gave me the SAMSUNG UK telephone number. When I contacted Samsung UK, they told me that from the IMEI number that the phone was made in South Africa. I asked them to give me the SAMSUNG South Africa telephone number and they told me that they did not know the telephone number.So my phone is now a piece of trash.This phone worked less than three months. While it worked, it was great and has very nice features. But it was not worth spending $500.00 for a phone that only worked for less than three months."
Positive,"I bought this for my mother and she loves it. When I played with it a little bit I couldn't really notice the difference between this and my s3 --other than this is a big phone. However, for my mother this was perfect for reading and all that kind of stuff so she loves it! It is really light but big so unless you really want something big the s3 or s4 would suffice"
Positive,This phone is great. It is much better than Galaxy Note which I owned before buying Galaxy Note 2. I enjoy it
Positive,"excellent product, recommend it to all, attention was good, It is a very useful and good product for all people"
Positive,"Seriously, this is one of the best investments I've ever made. Since I got it out of the box, I've been that much more organized and I can actually review my student's essays from the device! I'm not even eager to upgrade to the Note 3 at this time because I enjoy this phone so much!"
Positive,"My advice ""Get a case, a thick, heavy duty drop re4sitant rubber case case these notes are very fragile mine fell to road while I was running across the street 45 days old and yup it is in a pile on the counter as I attempt to change the glass on it myself. now I broke the bottom home button ribbons etc etc etc. Before it broke the phone changed my life. I think the smart man buys the Note 3 with the little smart watch . Note 2 is old new hate to say I should of waited for Not 3"
Positive,"There are plenty of reviews going in depth in specs and its capabilities. I am sure you have read any reviews here on Amazon as well as other websites how good or bad this Note 2 is. All I will say that this is my second Note phablet - an upgrade from the original Note One from exactly one year ago - and with its additional static memory together with being able to add up to 64Gb micro SD card for more apps or videos or photos, this photo meets my needs. Have no plans to upgrade to the Note 3 (yet!!) and if I have the urge to change to a new phone, I might try the new Nexus 5 which I got for my wife.The one noticeable thing about this Note 2 over my Note 1 is the battery usage. I had purchased additional batteries but saw no need as this Note 2 manages battery usage very well. Only 70% left after a hard day of surfing the web with the occasional phone call. Have this phone for 6 months and has nor bored me just yet."
Positive,"Buyers beware for the above cell phone i.e samsung galaxy note ii GT-N7100- FACTORY UNLOCK--16GB GRAY. The phone in question has no in-built sim card, like AT& T,AND T MOBILE. The seller is not being sincere and was trying to deceive buyers . This information is for whosoever may want to buy this phone."
Positive,This seller is a scammer. Well offers Galaxy note GT N7100 2 And upon receiving the phone is another reference which does not help. And he refuses to answer. It's not a star deserves.
Positive,"The device itself is fine as long as it works. Less than a year, one day it did not work at all... no response... nothing except a dim flash of red LED on top when trying to start it.The worse part is that it is not covered for support in the united states. They refer you to hear and there and finally you are left with a dead piece. Sad."
Positive,I am a first time smart phone user and figured that they would be hard to navigate. I bought a nock of this phone and I was right. It failed promptly and I sent it back. I bought this Samsung phone and WOW what a world of difference to use. EASY. I LOVE IT. It is worth all the difference in cost as the ease of use and total over all Quality of the Phone is Night and Day. Thanks Amazon for the selection of phones to cater to all customer price ranges. You Guys Rock
Positive,"You get what you pay for. I wanted an unlocked smart phone and this one works great. No problems since the purchase date. We did not want the hassels of dealing with a contract and we went with Walamrts Family Talk Plan. 2 lines $85 a month, unlimited talk, unlimited text, unlimited data (not 3G speeds, I am not that much a a data user). We have wi-fi set up in our condo and it works great when we do access the internet. This phone is worth every penny."
Positive,"The HD Super AMOLED display provides clarity, has a larger screen, but keeps your body lean that fits your hand perfectly. The quad-core processor 1.6 GHz integrated offers powerful performance and the S Pen offers several additional functions."
Positive,Its a really good phone thank u soo much it was a plessure t worm with u thanxs again hope too deal wiyh u again!!!!
Positive,"I was very disappointed with the product as it can only be used as a Sprint telephone. It is unlocked but not compatible with AT&T, T-Mobile. The add was misleading"
Positive,"I got this phone for my father, he LOVED it! The only problem he's had is that since it's so big, the glass is a bit more delicate than a smaller phone and when he accidentally dropped it, the screen cracked. It wasn't too difficult to get a new screen and now he has a protector to keep that from happening again :)"
Positive,I love this phone!!! It does everything I need plus some. So If you are thinking about getting a new smartphone and a tablet this is a great phone to go with.
Positive,"I'm posting months after the fact - finally was able to change my real name for a pen name on Amazon.This phone is probably the best piece of electronics I've purchased, it beats , IMO, the iPhone and is a tremendous help to me. I can do and ""see"" spreadsheets comfortably, can see movies quite well and it brings a host of other benefits due to the large screen.This phones performance is fast and quite stable - no major issues."
Positive,"I haven't been a phone person since some years ago, but I can't put it down. I organize my whole life. Yeah it's big, but big comes with advantages. Think mini tablet that's more pocket friendly. I had a iphone before, I love the freedom and much bigger screen...NOTE 2 ROCKS!!!"
Positive,Note II is the best phone out there for people who love big screen phones. The connection is flawless. Great deal.
Positive,"this product is perfect, reliable, safe, I can recommend, is fast, isprompt, is express, is short, is economicpaying"
Positive,"The delivery was perfect, my expectation was almost to high but not apparently for the shipping company and the Samsung Galaxy note 2 cellphone, which is the phone of all phones for me. The screen size has changed the way I use and live with this tool. Wont be able to settle for less now.Teddy"
Positive,"I am an Apple fun‚Ä¶ but I love the Samsung Galaxy Note II GT-N7100. Light. Great resolution. Multiple tasking. Appropriate for Designers, Architects and anybody that needs to work with design notes."
Positive,The size grow on you within a few days..All other phones feel like toys there on..If you love Tech there is always something new to try on this phone..It will make you forget your Tablets if you own one..One of the only phones on the market that still turn heads..check out my Video reviews on my YouTube Chanel...First look https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQZjn4U4lgY12 hrs later https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFDZxENFqF8
Positive,"If you've read any of the positive reviews, then you know what to expect from this phone. If I have any negative comments, it is only that the battery life could be longer. Aside from that I don't see upgrading anytime soon. Not even for the Galaxy Note III."
Positive,They sent me a broken phone that wouldn't turn on. I did get my money back a month later. Don't do it!
Positive,I really enjoy playing and working with my galaxy. It exceeded my expectactions! I would recommend it. It worth the price.
Positive,"Very affordable, functions great, very easy to use, I would definitely recommend this product to my friends and my family!"
Positive,I have never seen that before ??? I used this galaxy for 2 hours and then I got a message to update the software I press OK then .... its DIE ....the galaxy now just flashing with words ( samsung galaxy note II ) thats it !!!!!!!what I have to do now ?
Positive,"I'm not sure, but I think I may have come close! My phone (my buddy) tells me when things are going on, it keeps my schedule, reminds me of appointments or birthdays or kids soccer games. Will it rain today? It tells me to take my umbrella!Well, I don't use umbrellas, but if I did, it would tell me!Any and everywhere I go it can tell me how to get there, what time I will most likely arrive due to traffic, show my traffic patterns!We're not quite there yet, but soon enough it will start monitoring my over all health. BP, Pulse, Temp. Bloody thing will know when I have a heart attack before I do! And possibly be able to prevent it or call for help without my asking it to!I love it! It, of course cannot love me. Which is a drawback to the relationship. :)I understand they are working on that now....not sure I'm ready for that sort of thing emotionally. I rather like the feel of a woman's skin on mine if you see?John."
Positive,"Terrible customer service..... The equipment did not work with pop mails, it erases the email without reading, it's not a problem of configuration. This device apparently has this problem. Additionally we tried to contact the seller several times and did not get any answer. To top this, Samsung America does not help you with a solution to any problem regarding an unlocked phone because this equiptment comes from another provider outside America. Very disported overall."
Positive,"Did a lot of research before I ordered this product from AMAZON, it arrived on time, modified my SIM card to make it a microSIM installed it together with my MicroSD card. No problem :)Now I am using my Galaxy Note 2 and very happy that I made this purchase.Another great buy from AMAZON."
Positive,"better than my galaxy s3,bigger screen bigger battery and bigger ram,love it so much, and all the function of the phone just like a pc."
Positive,"This is not the product I thought I was getting. It IS NOT a 16 GB device, but rather 10GB. It came set up in Spanish and I suspect it was an inferior device intended for sale in Mexico. I am very disappointed in this purchase, and do not plan to buy electronics online in the future.Shame on you for misrepresenting this item"
Positive,"This is the best Samsung phone i have every had. Out of all of the samsung phones I have ever had this is by far the very best. I love the apps and the big screen is amazing. I promise if they comeout with a note III I will be getting it. The battery life is the best I can go dasys without charging and I do a lot on my phone from emailing, playing games, watching movies, and I even connect via bluetooth to my radio to ply music."
Positive,Thank u the phone it's excelled perfect to my business and my job so everything works good one more time thank u
Positive,I've bought this because the needs with my job. It is a great phone and it works fine. I still try to figure-out all the things it does but I feel great about this phone day by day.
Positive,"I already knew what the Note II was, and that I would like it, and it went above and beyond my expectations. Hands down the best phone you can get.I am running this phone on Straight Talk with their SIM for ATT phones, and it works great, and only costs me $48 a month after taxes on their $45 plan.So if you can afford to get a phone outright, it's the best way to go."
Positive,"WORKS GREAT WITH MY SAMSUNG GALAXY NOTE II. MODEL N7100MULTIPLE FUNCTIONS ... FAST ON THE SELECTION OF APPLICATIONS .. 8MP PHOTOGRAPHS OF EXCELLENT QUALITY AND VIDEO is likewise ... You can shoot video and take photos without switching applications ... Open files. PDF,. WORD, or .PPT not ARE NEED THE SOFTWARE (ADOBE OR MIC. OFFICE) that would require to be worked.If you love video games is an option ... This phone is nothing difference with the DS OR VITA .."
Positive,"This phone is amazing. It is fast, beautiful, and smart. It has all the bells and whistles. Well worth the money.*** If you are getting the international version in the US, please beware that this phone with not get 4G speeds. It will only get 2G. The branded US versions will get 4G speeds. ***I selected the unlocked international version for several reasons. First, I am not stuck with a single carrier for the life of the phone. Second, this version is not full of a bunch of silly, carrier-specific software. Third, it will work internationally if I travel with just the change of the SIM card. Lastly, it has an FM radio that is missing from the carrier-specific US models. This is my first smartphone, and I couldn't be more impressed. With the phone in easy mode, it is easy enough to learn, even for someone who is not especially skilled with technology. I love this phone and couldn't be happier with it!"
Positive,"Greta looking phone better some and you can do so much more just the fact you can share your picture or music throught bluetooth, bigger screen, just got to get used to android. I switch from iphone to samsung."
Positive,"1. Purchased my Note II cellphone on Nov 19, 2012. Received it barely more than a month, it wouldn't detect the SIM card anymore, and sometimes shut down by itself. Of course there is no accident to the phone, and just normal use. My phone company replaced a SIM card, and it still wouldn't work.2. Contacted with the seller, SurgeTelecom through Amazon on Jan 13, 2013 and they wouldn't allow to return or replace it, since it is more than a month from shipping, though the Amazon holiday return ends on Jan 31, 2013.3. Called Samsung US support, they told me this is a UK model. Samsung US will not support the cellphone, and told me to ask Samsung UK for help. It is not easy to get help from UK, since I am in US.4. Issued a claim to Amazon for selling the UK model without noticing in the description on Jan 16, 2013. Asked to replace the cellphone with a US model or get full refund. 4 days passed, and no reply from Amazon yet.I will update the progress.5. After 5 days, Amazon replied: ""you did not contact the seller within 14 days of receipt to report the issue or return the item within 30 days of shipment.""6. Contacted Samsung UK, I need to send the broken phone from US to their UK service site for checking. I need to pay the shipping fee.7. Shipped the phone to the UK service center on Jan. 28 and arrived Great Britain on Feb. 7 with the Express Mail International information: ""Payment of charges - Item being held, addressee being notified."" It seems the phone still didn't reach the UK service center.8. Called the UK service center, they asked me to call the post office to see why the item didn't deliver. Called the UK post office but couldn't go through. Sent an email request to the post office, no reply got.9. March 11, 2013 EMS tracking ""Unclaimed - Item returned to sender"". I may have to keep the broken phone.10. March 23, 2013 the phone was returned. The reason on the parcel box is that the Customs/Postal charges didn't pay. The total charge is ¬£69.97 (VAT ¬£56.47 and Parcel force handling fee ¬£13.50). The UK service center didn't pick up or didn't want to pick up the phone to repair due to the Customs/Postal charges.11. Sent to a private repairing site in CA."
Positive,"The title explains it all. Don't think twice about buying this phone, you get the best of both worlds. Is it a bird? Is it a plane ? It's a Phablet!"
Positive,The note is designed to operate in Europe and not America. I tried AT&T and T-Mobile and none of the apps worked. All I could do was listen to my music and make and receive calls. The site did not address this in the information about the phone.
Positive,"It is a good size screen so he can see his videos, holds music, apps, etc. stylish. Not great price, but all phones are ridiculous these days."
Positive,"Hi,I don't have to say much.I recommend this product, everything is okey.The box include the next:1. Cellphone2. Headphones3. Batery4. USB Cable + Adapter5. Part for the headphones6. ManualI'm very happy with the seller... Thank you very much! :)"
Positive,"I normally wouldn't bother with reviewing anything, but at first I was reluctant to buy a used cell from anywhere. I took a risk and chose to buy one through one of Amazon's third party venders "" Open Group Wireless"". I ordered the phone on April 17 and received it on the 19th (standard shipping). My phone was in EXCELLENT condition. Came with all of it's accessories. +10 up Amazon and Open Group Wireless. I haven't had any issues with my product at all. No scratches!"
Positive,I love the big screen and the photos from the camera are amazingly sharp! I would recommend it to people I know.
Positive,"I bought this phone primarily as I dislike the small screens of the first few generations of smart phones. This phone is a very fast, has a beautiful display, and works great. I use the stylus for notes and for crossword puzzles. Phone works great with or without the stylus.Would buy another, for sure."
Positive,Phone never worked--bad motherboard! :o(
Positive,Very perfect phone and its fast
Positive,Awesome product used it when I traveled out of the country
Positive,This phone doesn't adhere to the standards and the product description outlined. This hone cannot be used neither internationally nor in USA.Will not prefer this phone
Positive,Perfect
Positive,Excelent product!
Positive,Excellent
Positive,"I can't complain. The product was good and arrived quickly and as advertised. No problems, which is always a good thing."
Positive,"I waited a long time for this and I made the right decision. I just pulled the T-Mobile SIM from my other phone, popped it in this one and we are up and running. I did have to trim my SIM to a micro SIM but that was easy. There are many easy to follow tutorials and templates on the internet for trimming a regular SIM down to a micro SIM. Just search for ""how to trim a sim card to micro sim""Like it was said before, this a is a computer with a phone inside it. I love everything about it, it's easy to use, easy to set up, it connects to WiFi quicker than my home computer. The stylus with writing recognition software is great for my chicken scratch writing.I was initially worried about the size of the phone and whether it would fit in my pocket. I can say it fits in the back pocket of every pair of pants I have worn so far and I am already used to the size of the phone, even just after a week of use.I gave it 5 stars because I couldn't give it more.Very, very happy with the Galaxy Note 2."
Positive,Very quick delievery no problems what so ever thanks a lot :)I hope other people but this awesome phone
Positive,"I've had this 'Phablet"" (phone and tablet) since around the middle of December and it has become indispensible!Aside from the usual: camera, video recorder, voice recorder, calendar (which I find so convenient I've stopped using my paper diary), calculator, movie player, music player (total entertainment system really), WiFi, Bluetooth, internet, email, etc.: with the built-in stylus and S-Note I am never without something to jot a quick note whilst I'm on a call, doodle, draw multi-coloured pictures with a variety of nib sizes, or hand write notes in class. I no longer have to carry a notebook to school, I have the notes for four subjects on my fabulous, phablet which I ALWAYS have with me. I can cut and paste from the screen and add it to an SMS or email message; or, whilst on a call, draw directions and send it to the person I'm speaking to with just a couple of clicks. I may sound gushy, but I love this phone! I really don't know what I did before I had it.Apps are unending: recipes, to-do-list, shopping lists, flashlight (using the camera flash), several versions of the Bible, an office app to do spreadsheets, word processing and even power-point, dictionaries, translator, currency converter, Kindle, Skype, you name it, it's on my phone.I bought a 64GB memory card at the same time and have loaded NCIS Series 8 (over 20 shows); Suits series 1 & 2; loads of music and pictures, and around 10 full-length movies so I am never bored.I also bought a Zenus Color Point Wallet Case with it: so . . you guessed it, it's also my wallet, I no longer carry a seperate wallet, i have all my cards in it and a few dollars for cash purchases.I have even sold my iPad 2 as I found I wasn't using it anymore, I can do everything on the Note 2 (ok, the screen's amaller than the iPad, but I can still comfortably watch movies on it), AND without the case full of cards and money, it fits into my shirt pocket.My Note 2 has also replaced my internet service provider as my phone company has 4g, I just tether and use it as a hotspot with my laptop anywhere I go (I have an unlimited plan), and it's FAST, faster than my previous internet service. Did I tell you I LOVE this phablet?Oh yes, the phone works great too. :-) Clear as a bell, great reception, I've been using the headphones that came with it for calls as well as entertainment media as the phablet IS a little large to put to my ear. However, the microphone on them appears to be failing (they have lasted longer than any other headphones I've ever had, I'm pretty rough on them), lately people are saying I sound faint unless I hold the mike to my mouth.Battery life is awesome, especially with Power Saving on, I've gone 3 days without charging if I don't use it as a hotspot or watch a movie (hotspot drains it FAST, even with P.Saving enabled).After 3 months I am still finding new things it can do, or that I can do on it (there's an S-Voice controller, and gesture controls which I haven't got around to using yet).If you just want to make a call, this phone is not for you as the learning curve is kinda steep (I HATED it the first week I had it as I was replacing my BB Torch which had stopped working and it took me a while to fugure out how to use my new android), but if you don't mind a pretty steep learning curve, with total satisfaction at the end of it, this is the device for you."
Positive,"DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE!!!!I dont' know who to blame, samsung or the seller. regardless, the phone was fine for the time I had it, but after 3 months of use, the phone all of a sudden died. No matter what I tried, the phone would not charge or come back on. I called samsung and they told me that since the phone was an international phone, that I had to contact the country where it was made and send it off to them for repairs. I am so furious right now I dont' know what to say. Apparently this is the same ""sudden death"" bug that affected many of the galaxy sIII's a few month prior and is happening to many other people who own the Note 2.If you live in the US, and were planning on buying a international phone, or any samsung phone for that matter, I would HIGHLY advise you against it. You get no us support, and the phone cannot be repaired in this country. A phone that I paid almost $700 for should die after 3 months of use. That is a bunch of bull$#^. You will also only get a very sh&^%y return policy from this seller."
Positive,MY PHONE WORKS GREAT!!!! I HAD A LITTLE SCARE IN THE BEGINNING BECAUSE I BOUGHT 2 AND THEY ARE ACTUALLY INTERNATIONAL PHONES BUT AFTER I TALK WITH SAMSUNG OVER THE PHONE I DECIDED TO BUY A STRAIGHT TALK SIM CARD. I BOUGHT T HE CARD AND CUT IT DOWN TO MICRO SIM SO THAT IT COULD FIT AND IVE BEEN ROCKING MY NOTEII EVERY SINCE!!! I LOVE IT. ITS THE BEST PHONE IVE EVER HAD
Positive,"I don't want to talk too much about technical specification of the device. Instead, I would like to first mention about the seller. There are tons of comments on the product here but only a few talk about the seller. Before buying this phone my main concern was to prefer the right the seller (considering there are many strange and unreliable seller in the market).I bought this product from Ranascorp (fullfilment by Amazon). The phone was shipped immediately and delivered in two days. I don't know why but when I opened the package I saw that the box was open. However, everything other than the open box was OK. The phone was brand new with protector films in place. The accessories were brand new as well (though I bought a titanium gray phone the accessories are white). Ultimately, I'm very happy with my purchase.The phone is literally amazing. From the very first moment I have been dealing with the phone almost every minute. Most people think that it has a huge size but believe me when you see that giant screen you will fall in love with it (though I'm 6' 3"" I still had some concerns on the size). As soon as you start using the phone you immediately get rid of your concerns on the size.I'm pretty sure that most of you are reading every article about the phone and checking every website before buying it ( exactly like I did) and you have many concerns like resolution, color saturation, super amoled screen etc. Guys, let me tell you something: do not hesitate even a moment to buy this phone. Be sure that you will never feel regret or look back to your old or new Iphone or other types of phones.I bought an Iphone 5 to my wife 2 months ago and when she saw my Note II she suddenly she started to dislike her Iphone:) Now, she wants another Note II for herself:)Now, a few things for who already have the phone. If you didn't do it I recommend you to have a look at youtube and search for ""Coldfustion's Android 3D UI Tutorial [Galaxy Note 2] "". When you see the things you can change and the new look of your Note II I'm sure you will not believe it. Of course, everybody using an android phone might have the same look but it would not be the same as in your Note due to the screen difference. I applied many of the things Coldfustion described in that video. I further customized different things thanks to the inspiration by Coldfustion. It's up to your creativity.As a conclusion, I'm definitely very happy with my purchase. This is a great device. I was going to buy a tablet but I don't need one now."
Positive,"The company was efficient in shipping. Phone was not tarnished in any way. The only downside was that I did have to acquire a Microsim card. However, the description of the product discloses that only the original accessories are included. Therefore, I was already informed prior to purchase. My phone carrier was able to provide me with the device anyway. I only write reviews after experiencing the product for a duration of time. After having the phone for a few months now, I am very satisfied with the purchase."
Positive,"Pros -Best Phone out there.. Hands down.5.5"" of awesomeness.Cons -Folks with small hands might struggle to use the device."
Positive,"This phone is amazing. The size of the phone is daunting to some people, but I am a very large man so it fits perfectly in my hand. My wife and I both bought one and she loves her's as well."
Positive,"this is the best cell phone ever, an amazing big screen and i it s truly unlocked so dont have to worry to be attach to a plan."
Positive,"Dear Jupiter Sellers,I purchased this phone from you from US Amazon in April 2013. The Amazon description did not explain that it's an international phone with NO US WARRANTY that can only be serviced by a UK Samsung Center. This is deceptive; if you are going to sell phones to US customers, you should explain if they do not have a US warranty. The SIM tray just broke and the phone is not working. Samsung is requiring me to call their UK service center to arrange for service. However because I do not have a working phone, I cannot make an international call! They do not give an option to arrange for this service over email or calling a US affiliate.I would be grateful if you could please contact me to offer to call Samsung UK at 0121 643 7373 to book this purchase for repair, in which case I would delete this negative review."
Positive,"Absolutely the best phone I have bought to date. It has a good camera and the battery life is great, I can get through at least 2 days without a recharge.Pros: large screen and S-penCons: NoneI definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a new phone with all the bells and whistles."
Positive,"Excelente cell I'm so glad, nice video quality, super processor velocity, good dimension, all than I want in a Cellphone"
Positive,The phone is all I have always wanted in a phone I particularly like the size which allows me to use the phone without wearing a pair of glasses. It has all that I want and even more. Im taking my time in exploring it so that I can maximize its use.I will recommend it to anyone that wants a phone -tablet because that is what it is.
Positive,"First, let me say I was nervous purchasing a mobile phone online without the hand-holding that a brick and mortar store provides. However, I was so over the killer bills from my carrier every month, I was willing to buy unlocked and go to another carrier who would maximize my use and minimize my cost.In purchasing, I was pleased by Worldwide Distributors, which is backed by Amazon. I felt the risk was worth it. The phone arrived on time, in perfect condition, and was clearly new and unused. Relief! Now, to the product...I live in a family of iPhone users- I'm a Mac computer lover, but have veered off the Mac path for mobile phones. Have had several Blackberry's, a Droid Global 2, and most recently a BB 9930 which I loved for its keyboard, security and ease of use, but the screen is quite small.Enter Samsung Note 2, simply the best phone I've ever had. I was worried that I would struggle to learn it, as I'm no tech geek... but I was amazed at how simple it was to learn. (I was so worried, that I kept my other phone and number, figuring it would take a good month to get the hang of the Note 2. Because of the urgency of my being accessible by phone for emails and calls, I did not want to take any chances.) BUT- guess what? I ported my number over the.very.next.day- I had learned the phone in a few hours!Ease of use, A.Although it may seem large for some, it is truly a marriage of a phone and a tablet! I now can see traveling without my heavy Mac laptop- this puppy can do it all. With available keyboard and multifunction dock, this is truly a break-through device. I never listened to much music on my previous phones, or watched video- why bother? The screens on prior devices were teensy and the sound quality not-so-great. I am AMAZED at the sound quality of this phone, just from the stock headphones that come with it! The screen is a perfect size for viewing anything- no more having to zoom in. The ability to hand-write notes, cut and paste, draw, etc. is incredible. I have not gotten into all that the S pen can do, but there are so many possibilities...The quality of the screen is A+, very clear, and although someone had suggested in a review somewhere to use movie mode for good color saturation, I kept the standard mode. The screen is perfect for viewing TV and movies. It is absolutely (to me, anyway,) the best of all worlds. There are so many wonderful personal adjustments that can be made, it feels like a phone that is more EASILY customizable than any mobile I've owned.Have found no drawbacks yet- have only had it up and running for three days, so will be back should I have any problems with it.Honestly, I love this phone- and yes, I'd marry it! :)"
Positive,"I have had this phone for a month already, and I can say that I am still discovering new features I didn't know it had... Even after watching tutorial videos I still find new things.Iphone 5? You can't compare that to the Note 2. It would be like comparing a BMW 335i to a Bentley Continental Supersports.If you are looking for a phone, get this one.Update 07/10/2013Unfortunately my phone suffers of the SDS (sudden death syndrome) and it freezes and crashes like 5-6 times every day... this is getting very frustrating since I spent almost $700 on this phone just 8 months ago. I never rooted or did anything you are not supposed to do with this phone. I made some research about this problem and it appears like lots of other Note IIs and Samsung Galaxy S IIIs suffer from this same problem. I wish I could get a replacement or my money back, things like this happening to such High-end (expensive) phone is plain ridiculous. I am very disappointed with you Samsung! I hope I am contacted my someone.Thank you.Update 07/13/2013This is completely unacceptable!!! This phone now freezes as soon as I reboot it when trying to unfreeze it!!! This is my second bad experience with ""high end"" Samsung devices!!! I will never buy from Samsung again, sorry but you lost a very good LOYAL (bought several big screen TVs, a sound bar and mobile devices all the time) customer because of this awful experience with devices I payed for $685 (Note II) and $630 (Galaxy Tab 10.1 that had very bad screen problems.I hope at least anyone in here takes the time to contact me."
Positive,"How fast is this phone? Ridiculously fast. How cool is this phone? Plus-ultra-chic. How good is the handwriting interface? Okay, it drops in a lot more capital letTers than iT should. But if you watch the options above the scratchpad you can fix flaws with a quick tap. And it is freaky fast reading my chicken scratches. Did I mention this phone is fast?Other folks can tell you about the specs for this phone and how it compares to that fruit company's phones and the other Androids. For me it is all about usability and this is the ultimate in my experience. There is a reason the fruit folks have sued Samsung - they cannot compete in quality/value. Between the Note and the S III, Oppa Samsung is kicking it Gangnam style. I should mention I have had a fruity phone - truly don't miss it. Best of all, no iTunes. Relief! Amazon MP3 and Kindle Apps are my new best friends.And if someone gives you guff about how big it is, fire up Netflix and show them about any movie. After they go quiet tell them ""Yeah, size matters.""I have no trouble remotely logging into a server and doing a few quick tasks. Remote mouse clicks are slick with the stylus. Reading a book is a pleasure. Short Emails are no trouble. Browsing the Web is very doable. I can turn my notebook off for days and not miss it.Works well with T-Mobile. T-Mobile worked well with me. I wandered into one of their stores, had a micro SIM card and a working phone in less than ten minutes. If you're already on Android then switching to a new Android phone is completely lacking in any pain whatsoever. If it does hurt then you're doing it wrong.Okay, this phone is not for everyone, but if you think you could use an Android on Steroids, don't hesitate."
Positive,"I just can't believe the change we saw on mobile phones in just less than 5 years. I started with a BB curve like 4 years ago, then I bought an iPhone 4 when it was launched and was amazed again. Then, 6 months ago I moved to Android with an N7000 that amazed me so much I had to get the new Galaxy Note II as soon as I could.And even when the N7000 is also incredible, this new version of the Note has been improved in every aspect. It's so fast, so smooth, even sexy as it feels when I hold it. Can't say nothing else but ""GET ONE ASAP""...The only problem was (until a week ago) that I had to stick to the samsung stock rom for almost a month. It's not bad but it's full of apps I don't use and drains your battery faster. But now I'm even happier since CM10 has been officially realeased for the N7100 and the phone is even faster than before and the battery lasts longer."
Positive,"a device that makes your life easier, fast and friendly in internet navigation, a lot of free and good aplications amd widgets, you get addicted to it."
Positive,"Great buy, bought this for a samsung fan and he likes the phone ! Thx Samsung for the creation of Note"
Positive,I bought this phone for my little sister.She lves to draw and i thought the Spen and all the awesome features this phone has are perfect for that. Well she Loves it. She has gotten a bunch off different apps for drawing and she uses it for homework or anything else she might need. The screen is perfect size for watching movies and shows. It makes me wanna trade in my gs3 for one of these.
Positive,"This is a great phone for what I've needed it for. From the size to the functions, it's an great investment."
Positive,"Bought this phone through Amazon last April and it's (by far) the best phone I have ever owned. The display is crisp and perfectly sized. The S pen is a great feature, especially if you don't have a paper and pen handy. Overall, I would recommend this phone to anyone who doesn't mind thinking outside of the iphone box."
Positive,I absolutely love this phone...it's totally awesome. The screen size is just right not too small or too big and all the graphics are very dynamic.
Positive,My husband loves his phone he has not had a single issue with it and it is easy to use and has all the features and programs that he needed.
Positive,"This product is the best, 100%, software updated daily, all applications Play Store you imagine at your fingertips.psxpro responsible and very helpful in answering questions."
Positive,"I purchase that phone for me and my husband, I love it my husband love it I recommend that product."
Positive,Its a nice phone to have but I got my phone with a crack in the screen...but other then that um very happy with my phone
Positive,Recomendable
Positive,"it's not what I expected it. It was not an original phone!!!! There were no Playstore app and tried looking for hours and hours! I even took it to the Tmobile store and they said this was not an original phone, it was an immitation. I was really really disappointed."
Positive,The phone arrived on time. It was fantastic. Not a scratch anywhere. My husband loved it.
Positive,Everything is Ok!
Positive,Excelent
Positive,"Excellent phone...Great performance, screen is truly immersive. Phone blazes thru tasks and when on the road, do not need tablet as phone easily handles that."
Positive,"This phone itself is amazing and beautiful but because of some baseband restrictions on the international version you can only get Edge(1g-2g) speeds on Tmobile's network which renders the phone pretty much useless. Steer clear if you plan on using this on T-mobile's gsm network. Also, on ATT you can only get 3g speeds. Forewarned. I wish I had known before I ordered one. Thankfully amazon's return policy rocks."
Positive,"I was happy with this phone, but it has 4 dead pixels. Looks horrible. Its sad. I paid 600 dollars for this"
Positive,I bought 5 of these phones on behalf of someone else. I have now talked with them and they really liked the phones. All the users are happy and the transaction was very easy. I will be doing more business with Amazon in the future.
Positive,Do not buy phones from these people I bought one and it was reported stolen from someone so just letting you all know.
Positive,Best phone ever. Fast . Sharp images. Multitasking friendly use. You can carry your office in your pocket. I recomend this phone 100%.
Positive,"The phone that was described on e site was nothing at all like I was expecting. The delivery and packaging were he only good things about this phone. I had purchased this phone full retail price minus gift card and shipping hoping that I could use the factory unlocked phone on my cellular network. Wanted the option of not having to extend my contract and hopefully use the phone somewhere else if needed. I didn't know the phone could only be used internationally, at least that's what I was told when I took it up to Verizon hoping they could activate the phone for me. But there was no ESN number in the phone and SIM card would not register the phone. Do not buy unless you fully research this phone which was a mistake on my part. I will say I have purchased the note through Verizon and its one of the best phones out there, way better than the iPhone 5."
Positive,"Even if it have a big screen, it's very comfortable to use and it's performance is the best...."
Positive,Was not happy said it could be used with Verizon and it can not now i have a 700 dollar paper weight false advertisement
Positive,"When you get the Note 2 out of its box, your first reaction will be to its enormous size!But honestly, it's not a problem. It will fit in your jeans pocket, assuming your jeans aren't too tight, and you won't really notice its extra weight.Some will find it absurd, but those who want a big screen with loads of beautiful detail, a much better battery and some cool pen features will ""get"" it within 10 minutes of holding it for the first time."
Positive,lo maximo. el mejor telefono tablet que he tenido! sin duda alguna por ahora nada se le compara!! vale la pena comprar un equipo de estos!
Positive,"Before I bought this I was wondering whether to get a tablet and keep my current phone (Samsung Galaxy S II) with it. However, after reading several reviews and watching hours of reviews on you tube, I realized that this is the perfect device with capabilities of a phone with almost the size of a tablet. As a college student, I think this phone + tablet helps me to keep up with current news, my schedule, taking notes (thanks to the S-Pen), and really good multimedia features. I bought the device about 20 days ago and it arrived on time. Below I have listed some pros and cons of the device, according to my personal knowledge and experience.Pros:Call Quality is very good5.55"" Super Amoled ScreenS-PenQuad-core Processor with 2GB RamBattery lasts easily a day at leastLED Notification lightPhysical Home key buttonGood quality speakerRemovable batteryExpandable storage optionsCons:The screen quality could be a bit better because the screen is one of the main features (selling points) of this device.I realize Samsung makes most of their phones with plastic, as was the case with the SII, however, it might be time to change the material to something more appealing to the consumers.Software:The device comes out of the box with Android 4.1, and then I had an update to 4.1.1 which added the multitasking feature.Overall, the Android experience has become much smoother. (coming from the SII's Gingerbread and Ice Cream Sandwich)Google Now is much better than S-Voice.Samsung has created one of the smoothest & fastest phones on the market as of now by combining Android software with amazing hardware.Confusions regarding this device:LTE - The international version of this device does not have LTE capabilities. However, if you were to get it under contract from AT&T, Verizon, or U.S Cellular, then you will get LTE capabilities.Home Button Lag - There seems to be a slight lag when you press the home button. This is because, by default, the phone is expecting the user to press it again to access the S-Voice feature. The S-Voice has come a long way, but personally, I prefer Google Now. So the way to fix this lag is by----Go to Apps---Select ""S-Voice""----Click menu button---Select Settings---then De-select ""Open via the Home key"" option. And the lag should be gone now.Capacitive button light duration - The phone by default has the capacitive light duration at either 1.5 seconds or 6 seconds. However, if you are having a hard time locating these buttons without the light, you can always change the setting under Settings---Display---""Touch key light duration""--then select the option you prefer.Updates - The updates are directly handled by Google and Samsung. So there is no carrier interference here. Since the Google updates their Nexus devices right away when there is an update available, I expect the unlocked version to be updated shortly after them. May be a month or two at the most. However, the carrier versions of this phone may take several months to an year or more to get updates. (Speaking from personal experience with AT&T SII update from Gingerbread to ICS)Personal Experience:Personally, I would recommend this phone to anyone who doesn't mind the huge screen size, and the inability to do some one handed tasks. However, the pros for this device far outweigh the minor cons. Most importantly, the device makes really good quality calls and there is no issues with that (AT&T service). One of the highlights of the phone is its battery. After I unplugged it at 7 am at 100%, then I used the phone for several calls, hundreds of texts, some you tube videos, about an hour of web browsing, played several games, Wi-Fi was on, and the screen brightness at medium, when I came back home at about 7pm, the phone still had about 70% charge remaining."
Positive,"I've had this phone for a week now and I love it! Best phone ever! I really can't say anything else that isn't already written. I have set this phone up using Straight Talk and my number from Verizon ported in minutes and I am never looking back!This screen is big enough to see and use but still the size of my check book so I can carry it with me. Taking notes at a conference people asked what it was. A woman at work saw it and I told her I ""Yeah, I just dragged that video from my computer...no Ifriggin tunes"" She was more and more bummed about her iphone as I told her about the phone and showed her what it did. In the end she was ""I feel bad about wanting to leave apple now.""There are idevices, TomTom devices, and Nokia devices I wish I hadn't purchased now...If only I knew this was coming!Update: 11/19/2012 Phone is still great..but the case I had purchased for it used a magnet to hold clasp down. Thought at first ok cool. Then I found the spen acted funny. Could not draw a straight line from one side to the next. The line would go strange angles on one side. Then I removed the phone from the case and hey straight lines across the whole screen! Keep magnets away! I hope no permanent damage to the phone has been done. Seems stupid design of case! Phone awesome, separate case sucks so just warning to be careful when buying a case made for note II."
Positive,"This may be the last smartphone that I may need. I have my own business, and before I had to travel with my laptop and or tablet. All I need now is my Samsung Galaxy Note 2. It can handle my spreadsheets, help me edit drawings and pictures. I have the wallet looking case that houses the unit. So now my credit card, driver's license, business cards are all together with my phone. Love it. Also, switched to a new provider by the name of SOLAVEI. Their service is $49 per month. That is for no contract, unlimited service on the T-Mobile network. They are customer driven. You actually get $20 back each month for every three members you get to enroll. So if you enroll 9 members you will get back $60 each month from Solavei. They're relying on the members to utilized their social network to advertise. Check them out at [...]"
Positive,The best phone i have ever had! I wish it could be a little cheaper but otherwise the best of the best so far!
Positive,"THIS IS THE BEST PHONE EVER AS YOU CAN READ ON ALL THE REVIEWS BELOW, I BOUGHT IT 3 WEEKS AGO! IS SUPER FAST! THE SCREEN IS AMAZING, STYLUS IS GREAT! Im from mexico and a lot of friend want to to buy one of this now! If you are hesitating about getting this one! please dont! 10 times better than an iphone 1, 2 3,4 or 5!"
Positive,"I purchased this phone from them and when I received the package the plastic sealing was missing which I didn't care.I opened the boxing and started the phone. It worked and seemed to be fine. After exactly 32 days the phone just went silent and when I restarted it again there was no more sound coming out of it!!! I contacted the seller and explained everything and they did not accept any responsibility for exchange of warranty on a 700 USD purchase! I could not use the warranty from samsung either since the phone was not a USA version. So do not purchase anything from them, since they do not car about the customers. As soon as they get their money, you will be on your own!!! Poor quality and no service!"
Positive,"Great PH, highly recommend. Note 3 has ANT+ that this doesn't and a few little things, but this Note 2 has what most people need.Got this for someone that rarely uses the PH, but now is addicted to it."
Positive,"Great deal, love doing business with you. I believe he is the best here. I strongly support you all here"
Positive,Was great while it lasted. Had it for several months.One drop on a regular floor in my house and it was done!
Positive,Excelente
Positive,My first samsung phone. Still have it.
Positive,Very good and working grate
Positive,"I bought this for my travels throughout SE Asia. Sims cards with additional minutes are cheap and I buy one for each country I visit. In Thailand, cards are easy to obtain in the ubiquitous 7/11 stores. Because I bought it unlocked, I can switch sim cards whenever I want to.This Samsung is versatile and easy to read/operate. The ""pen"" makes navigation convenient."
Positive,"Can't say enough, is most awesome phone I ever had bar none, love it! Everything works so well, so responsive and productive I can't put it down. The technology has FINALLY acheaved its goal. A smartphone that is smart and actually works on all levels. A real keeper."
Positive,haven't had a problem since i bought the phone. I recommend this phone to any one that like a phone that can do anything
Positive,"I love this phone, and couldn't see myself using any other phone as of writing this. Its fast, sleek, the stylus is a must have feature for those who need to write things down while taking a phone call. For starters I do not have any issues with my phone right now. But I did purchase a OEM Samsung HDMI connector. The device did not work. So I called Samsung USA. I understand this is an International phone, but I bought it on Amazon in the USA. It has the Samsung name it should be supported anywhere Samsung has tech support. So I called Samsung USA, and they said I have to call Samsung UK. As they have no knowledge of the international version. So Samsung is saying they don't know their product if its an international version. Ridiculous. That will cost me money calling long distance. That is unacceptable. I have recommended Samsung numerous times. But this has changed my mind about recommending and or purchasing Samsung products in the future."
Positive,"There's no reason to even think of buying another phone this is the one, its got everything you want and more!!Screen, battery life, multitasking wow I so Amazed"
Positive,"The best phone that I‚Äôve ever had!!! It does all the things that I need and some more, only a couple of things on the downside one is that after being an Iphone user for many years it‚Äôs a bit hard to learn how this one works (mainly because it has so many options that the Iphone didn‚Äôt, which is great because let‚Äôs you personalize your phone and your experience with it to a level no Iphone could) the other thing, at least for me is the S pen it‚Äôs also a bit hard to understand how does it work and what you can or can‚Äôt do with it. Everything else is on the upside, the size of the screen, the ability to use it as a flash drive, download programs on the go and then when you get home you can install them in your computer, and many many other things I may be forgetting right now, but for me it was a great change from the too restrictive Iphone/Itunes nightmare to a more friendly Android."
Positive,"As someone who has had every iphone sinse the first one, this is my first android based phone and while there are many actions that take more steps to complete the galaxy note 2 is a very goid embassador of the android family..."
Positive,"Mine crapped out at 14 months and nobody in USA can fix it. Moreover, there is NO VALID US WARRANTY on this device. I'v learned that the UK has a 2 year warranty, but they will not accept it for repair unless it is mailed from a UK address.Don't bother with this one and check any other unlocked deals from Amazon for warranty."
Positive,Very Very Very good Thank you very much a pleasure hope to deal with you again the best of the west.
Positive,THIS PHONE IS GREAT. I HAVE IT HOOKED UP THRU STRAIGHT TALK USING AT&T. I'VE HAD NO PROBLEMS WITH IT AND I AM COMPLETELY SATISFIED.
Positive,"do not deal with worldwide. They lied about my phone when I tried to return it. they told me they would give me a refund and then try to stiff me. they told me my phone came back wet after I returned it and they wanted to give me a 60 dollar credit on a $500 phone. after about 20 hours on the phone and my time Amazon finally fixed the problem for me and refunded me correctly. they seem to have changed their name since I bought their phone which is probably commonplace for them. if you should use them, ask them a lot of questions first. especially which network you will be on because they don't tell you in there an ad and then you will get stuck with the wrong phone without asking the right questions.good luck."
Positive,üòÄ
Positive,Would not work in Belize even tho I purchased it unlocked
Positive,I've enjoyed this phone and continue to enjoy it. It will take me several months to learn how to use all the features.
Positive,GOOD
Positive,Very good about reasonable price
Positive,"I love this phone! I found out about it in an article on ""cellphones for seniors."" Of course, this one was listed for those of us who are comfortable with technology. I did have a bit of a scare when I charged the phone and found it was ""speaking"" Korean but I was able to change it to English quickly. There was no problem in activating it in Peru, where I live. This is a super user-friendly phone and provides some of the features of a tablet so there is no more temptation to buy another computer-like toy that I don‚Äôt need. And the ""S"" pen makes writing messages or notes to myself very convenient - none of that ""thumbing"" out a message. I thought I would use the pen occasionally but I use it all the time because, for me, it‚Äôs quicker to write with it."
Positive,OMG its really nice
Positive,great
Positive,I love it
Positive,"Been using the phone now for about 2 weeks and am very happy with it! The screen size is a good compromise between a tablet and regular phone. Great for watching movies and reading books which is the primary reason for purchasing it! Also, the camera and video recorder is pretty impressive! Definitely happy with the phone!"
Positive,"I bought this for my dad who is a total ""technology dinosaur"" person who asks me on a daily basis how to make an attachment, lol.The point is that this phone is great, it's very user friendly software wise and it's reliable hardware wise. I think this pretty much resumes what anyone wants from a smartphone.The camera is really the best one I've seen on smartphones so far and I can say this phone allows you to adjust it very well to whoever uses it."
Positive,Great
Positive,"The phone was bad. I connected it almost tripped off my power supply in the house. It wasn't charging, tried another samsung charger, no way. Its a bad product from this this seller, I process a refund same day I got it. I ordered from another company and still expecting that, hopefully I get a good one."
Positive,It's a ripoff! Don't be fooled like I was out of $300 + you want get your money
Positive,"I do EVERYTHING from my phone. This phone is amazing. The camera is really good, the battery life is surprisingly decent even with heavy use. I have nothing negative to say about it at all!"
Positive,"the phone is on contract, so i cant use it"
Positive,Good product meet my demand i loc it i wll dedinately recommend it to friends. I got it on time and it works fine
Positive,I love this phone. I can use it for all types of tasks especially for work and school. You get used to the size after a while. Note: Does not allow LTE on tmobile. But you get HSPA+ which is 4G just not lte.....i think. Overall great device I do travel out of country a bit so having phone already unlocked is a big plus.
Positive,"excellent product, what I asked was expected, a quality 100 % , quality at low cost, the finish is spectacular, I recommend this product to buyers, are you going to like, thanks ..."
Positive,I use my Samsung galaxy note 2 for both business and personal. It meets all my expectations for both. I am very pleased
Positive,Well it worked just liked they said buy a micro sim card and thats it depending on your country is 4 g or 3 g it all worksLoved everything about the phone i know its a little big but hey thats why i got it so stop hating on my choiceOpen Group Wireless was the seller and will deff buy again from them by the way i always try to go with Fulfilled by Amazon if not i always get trouble but all my accessories were for the usa version so Im happy
Positive,"I've had the GT-N7100 (international version of the Samsung Galaxy Note 2) since the end of last November and for awhile I was really happy with it. Great screen, nice interaction, nice features, etc - until it just randomly stopped working one day. I was using it, then when I went to turn on the screen the next time, it just would not turn on and no sign of life except for a slowly flashing red LED. After doing some online search, I then discovered that this was apparently a common problem on the note 2 and, it would appear, also on the s3. I've NEVER had a phone (or any other electronic device, for that matter) die and not turn on again out of the blue, no warning or indication of problems whatsoever. I've tried all sorts of fixes suggested by different online forums, but no luck (I am an electrical engineer by training and know a few things about electronics... and no, I had not rooted the phone or done anything unusual to it.) Now I have a $600 brick!This, by itself, negates any positives of the phone. To top it off - Samsung does NOT service non-US versions of the phone in the US. I must contact a UK service support tech (on my own dime, and being 8 hours ahead of my time, does not give me a lot of call window) to see if they can do something with it. That pretty much means most of the unlocked Galaxy Note 2s you get in the US cannot be serviced in the US. Oh, and the 2 US service support techs I spoke with basically didn't care.This support policy by Samsung is pathetic and unacceptable, especially in view of how much they charge for these things! I will never buy another Samsung again, that is for sure!"
Positive,"Sikh Sikh Sikh, simply the best and such a Sikh phone, so Sikh!! Heart and kisses from the misses. I love this phone with all my heart and soul, yes I do"
Positive,"First to buy junk "" I phone"" when they first came out, then moved to he note one. That was a change from a cave man to the 1050's in technological jump. Getting the note two is a jump to the Jetsons!!!Still learning, two processes at once, copy or use between two process running at the same time WOW"
Positive,i love this phone. it can do anything i cant possiby imagine how they are evergonna improve on this device
Positive,Great phone everything i always wanted from a computer right here in the palm of my hand.Now that is power.
Positive,This phone is already broken lasted 3 weeks not happy
Positive,"Great smart phone! I have used it for a year and then gave it to my spouse to use. She loves the large format keyboard for sending text messages. The phone was too big for me to carry, but my spouse easily fits the Note II in her purse. The smart phone was factory unlocked, so no mobile phone company ads/splash screens were still on the phone. We used our own prepaid sim card from T-Mobile, and the phone has worked perfectly for sending text messages and for telephone calls. My spouse also uses it to check her email while we are traveling. The camera is also amazing as well as the time the battery holds a charge (we shut off the auto sync and updates from Google.....both battery killers). We like everything about this smartphone."
Positive,"I don't like calling it a phone its more a mini computer. I use it a lot for a GPS with mapquest, voice recorder for note taking. all the different android apps such as my car locator (I'll never buy another gray car everyone owns one!) my diet diary for tracking food.The device itself has plenty of storage, very quick speed, and long lasting battery. The 10mp camera really turns out great pictures. This is the best smartphone I've had yet and after a year of use I don't have one complaint."
Positive,"If you want a big screen mobile, almost a tablet, this smartphone allows you to get rid of other devices most of the time. The camera is very good and I don't need to take my tablet to work meetings. This phone does the work.This was the best purchase I've done this year!"
Positive,"If you can find a Note 2 (new) with 32GB or 64GB ROM, they are the ones to buy. What's left of the Note 2's 16GB ROM, approx 10GB from the factory, can disappear very rapidly. Fortunately all Note 2's allow up to 64GB memory via micro-SD card which is great for docs, pics, movies, videos and music. Wise to buy a micro-SD card, whatever the size, that is rated Class 10. As a 10.1"" tablet owner which has 1GB RAM, having 2GB RAM in the Note 2 makes operation perform very smooth. In the apps area there is Note 2 manual which I have referred to often as this device can perform so many different functions. My device is only one week old so I cannot state positively that the battery will last ten hours, but I would be surprised if it did not get nine hours or more in a hard days use of emails, video reviews, game playing, etc. And the battery recharges very quickly with the included adapter. Then there is the S Pen and camera that seem top notch but I have barely gotten around to them. With prices dropping it seems foolish to buy a used Note 2 with tons of ""Extras"" you will not use. I checked the prices of many used units and now am very happy with my New Note 2 from Amazon which shipped on time with no problems. An excellent handheld computer/phone."
Positive,"I have big hands so the phone is just right for me, also since i travel alot for my work, this phone fits right into my work style."
Positive,Excelent service. I got it on time. I love my galaxy note. I recomend this place to buy your electronic stuff.
Positive,shiping will never come on time dont order buy it from someone els almost lost my job waiting for this phone kuz i need a phone for work...........
Positive,"Before you decide to buy this phone, please spend five minutes to read my story.I purchased this phone from this seller at Amazon.com On December 12th, 2012.I cost me $639.11 at that time.It is perfect great for the first eleven months until novermber 10, 2013.It is suddenly dead with no reason. I tried all my way to solve the problem.(Changed a new battery. Hard reset and SOft reset.) But nothing happened.I called Samsung US. They told me I cannot get the manufacturer warranty from thembecause this is a international model. I have to find the particular manufacturerto ask them to get the warranty. They help me and figure out this is a UK model.Then I called Samsung UK and they took a week and told me they have no responsibilityfor this phone according to my IMEI number. This phone wasmade by Samsung Saudi Arabiaand then they give me a phone number in Saudi Arabia.Finally, I found the Samsung Saudi Arabia website and sent an email to them.They replied me and told me that manufacturer warranty is not for international customerand only for their domestic customer.I opened my Note II and found the words ""made by Samsung Vietnam"".I wrote an email to them and get the same result.They don't give the international customer manufacturer warranty.In the same time, I contact the seller about the issue.They reply me the phone has no manufacturer warranty.Why they don't tell users in advance.Now my 11 months old dead phone sleeps in my drawer.I don't know what I can do.Also I would appreciate If any one can let me know what I can do.---------------------------------------------------------------------To be honest, I don't want to get rid of my previous review wrote in Jan, 2013.The phone is great. I love it.It is all most perfect except the battery usage.I have to charge it less than 2 days.Also it takes about more than 8 hours to charge tht battery if you use a USB cable."
Positive,"Not the 4g of LTE version, but has all the advertised features. The size is not as huge as it seems and it became quite comfortable rather quickly.However even when fully charged and i try to use it during the day as both a tablet ( to do all my web surfing and checking e-mails, music) as well as a phone, i find that my battery needs recharing by 4pm."
Positive,"Maravilloso, r√°pido, ligero. La pantalla es grandiosa, y solo notas lo grande que es cuando lo metes en el bolsillo del pantal√≥n.Wonderful, fast, lightweight. The screen is great, and you will only notice how big is when you put it inside your pocket."
Positive,"It's an amazing device ,you can think of it as having a pad and a phone at the same time and enjoying all if their features."
Positive,"There's not from Samsung, I only found 2 can peel off label which shows Samsung (fake), although turn on the phone, not show Samsung, no water unlock screen, no S Pen app or other Samsung app. Case size like same as Samsung Note, but no Samsung on front and peel off label on back. Seller TechWorld101 only sent RNA label for me to return, but no return shipping label, there's a loss and that's not my fault to pay for it. I'll take more pictures to show that's not from Samsung, and take video to pack for return, wish I can get full refund. I purchased a lot of good stuff from Amazon, but can't trust to buy phone again."
Positive,"http://youtu.be/3q8VKnWeFTwThis is my phone function, but, Go4computers, seller for this product, said this is fully functioned !Is this looks okay? OMG!!!!!!!!!!!!I purchased Galaxy note 2 at Amazon, the seller was Go4computers.As you can see, S-Pen is not working properly. however, they said there is no problem to this phone and turn off 'air view' function. Is this common sense? I paid fully in order to use fully functioned phone !"
Positive,"Best Phone Ever! The S4 is better, but this one is Better that I thought! Better than the Samsung Galaxy S3"
Positive,"this is not the international version, this is t mobile version, dont sayid that if international this is a lie."
Positive,I would suggest some sort of tutorial to come with the phone. There is a lot to know as the phone can do almost anything. Love it! This will replace my phone and travelling with the laptop-a word to the wise when you go to set up your phone with your carrier as the phone takes a micro sim card and not all carriers have them
Positive,Excellent
Positive,"I ordered this phone for someone when I got it, to put in the sim card and memory card the slot for the cards was loose and falling out, I had to hold the slot to put in the cards, and right now the screen is white I cant see anything on it, it started with a white faded spot on the bottom right corner and after time it started to spread all over until I cannot see anything. I know I took long because I normally don't do reviews but the owner told me to do that so I just want to let the public know that the phone I got was a used one, please be aware of the seller"
Positive,Highly recommended!!! A+++
Positive,this is good item
Positive,"Lovely phone, delivered excellently. Packaged so well and safe to insure safe delivery. I am so pleased. I will buy more. Very vast delivery."
Positive,"I have quite a lot of experience buying flagship smartphones and I have never had such an experience with any other flagship.This phone kept failing on me, sometimes the screen stopped working and it wouldn't turn on, sometimes the speakers stopped working and sometimes the phone stopped charging and all of this within a three month period and most of the times when I took it to the repair center they said that it's not covered under the warranty and I ended up paying a lot for the repairs.I wouldn't recommend anyone buying a flagship from this company as it's not worth the price and the customer service is not reliable.I ended up throwing this phone away."
Positive,Best battery life I have ever seen in a phone. Still over 50% battery life when my Nokia and iPhone are completely dead. I hope that this phone proves to be as reliable as my Nokia and iPhone. I will keep you updated.
Positive,Excelents
Positive,excellent
Positive,Great phone! It may not be as the newer version but it works just as great!
Positive,Fast delivery and worked great.
Positive,CONSIGNMENT SHOP THE OTHER PRODUCT
Positive,"ME LLEGO EL PEDIDO A TIEMPO, COMPLETO Y EN BUENAS CONDICIONES LO RECOMIENDO NO HE VISTO NINGUNO TAN COMPLETO COMO ESTE"
Positive,"What I can say? Excellent condition, very well protected. I really love it, it's amazing how you discover something new and different every day."
Positive,"If you can deal with the size, this phone is the best out there.Great screen, super fast and responsive."
Positive,ME ENCANTA ESTE SMARTPHONE YA SABIA QUE IBA A SER COMO LO DESPUES DE TENERLO EN LA MANO OK GOOG
Positive,"All the process was perfect thanks, the envelope was great and the goods wad excelent im very happy with the product"
Positive,good product.
Positive,Initially the phone needed a unlock code. I contacted the seller and within minutes everything was taken care of. My daughter loves her new phone. I highly recommend this seller.. excellent customer service.I have 4 or these in my family now.. everyone is satisfied
Positive,Years later and I still have this phone with ZERO problems! The phone is still in top shape!
Positive,Muy bueno.
Positive,Love this phone
Positive,Excelente producto
Positive,"all excellent , thank you very much"
Positive,"First of all, if you are the type of guy that wears tight pants‚Ä¶This phone is not for you.Women won‚Äôt have a problem like a lot of people think, cause most of the time they have their phones in a bag! If you are a creative and artistic producer, director, photographer even screenwriters, this phablet (phone/tablet) is definitely for you. Some Key Features are:‚Ä¢ Quad-band GSM and quad-band 3G with 21 Mbps HSDPA and 5.76 Mbps HSUPA supportThe international version comes with 3G but NOT LTE keep this in mind if you want some LTE speed.‚Ä¢ 5.5"" 16M-color Super AMOLED capacitive touchscreen of HD (720 x 1280 pixel) resolutionThe screen is vibrant and vivid, and in the setting you can either change it for normal or movie, under normal preset you‚Äôll get a lot more battery life though.‚Ä¢ Android OS v4.1 with TouchWiz launcherOf course the android version at the time of release was Jelly Bean 4.1, but Samsung is already prepping an upgrade to 4.2.2, when you first connect your phone to kies or a wireless router you be prompted to update, this will take you to version 4.1.2 for the time being.‚Ä¢ 1.6 GHz quad-core Cortex-A9 CPU, Mali-400MP GPU, 2GB of RAM, Exynos 4412 Quad chipsetCurrently one of the fastest CPU‚Äôs around, I noticed no glitches or crashes for the 2 months test period I ran the Note II trough. The TouchWiz of Samsung runs fluently with the android OS and even with a full HD Live Wallpaper it kept performing at its best.‚Ä¢ S Pen active stylus with deep system integrationThe S-Pen is a piece of art. The best touch pen you‚Äôll find out there, the precision is awesome, and customization in S-Note is endless, Its does everything you need for taking notes, changing color with the press of a button, changing letter types when using the curser. Inserting bullets and number.It‚Äôs like having your own personal touch proof Microsoft office. With the S-pen you can also do the famous AirView. By simply hovering over the text and date on your calendar you can preview what is actually on the specific date. But also in the photo/video gallery you can preview what‚Äôs in a folder or view the video without having to open it.‚Ä¢ 8 MP wide-angle lens autofocus camera with LED flash, face, smile and blink detectionThe camera has a lot of features with AF and a bunch of other options you can take pictures that would leave professional photographers stunned, from night view till panorama, I would just take a day off and go take some pictures you‚Äôll se that like the S-Pen the camera also have some hidden secrets.‚Ä¢ 1080p HD video recording at 30fpsHD recording like the HD pictures doesn‚Äôt stay behind, there is 120fps, for high speed recording if you want to add some slow motion effect to your video, but there is also in recording zooming, so you‚Äôll never have to stop and start again.Of course there are a lot more cool features in the galaxy like:‚Ä¢ 16/32GB internal storage, microSD slot‚Ä¢ Dual-band Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n support‚Ä¢ GPS with A-GPS connectivity; GLONASS support, Digital compass‚Ä¢ NFC support‚Ä¢ Stereo Bluetooth v4.0‚Ä¢ microUSB port with USB host and TV-out (1080p) support, MHL, charging‚Ä¢ Accelerometer, gyroscope and proximity sensor‚Ä¢ Standard 3.5 mm audio jack‚Ä¢ Great audio quality‚Ä¢ Slim at only 9.4mm‚Ä¢ 1.9MP secondary video-call camera‚Ä¢ Document editor and file manager comes preinstalled‚Ä¢ Extremely rich video and audio codec support‚Ä¢ Huge 3100 mAh battery can give up to 16 hours of regular day use (Tested)But there are also some drawbacks like:‚Ä¢ Large size makes single-hand operation problematic‚Ä¢ No dedicated camera key‚Ä¢ All plastic construction (would have probably weighed a ton otherwise, though)‚Ä¢ No FM radio (the N7100 has one)And of course, only the international version has FM radio capability."
Positive,bien
Positive,"I love this phone, without a doubt the best phone out at the moment. Galaxy S4 included.The sheer number of features is amazing, it's like they thought of everything, even the idea that this many features could be daunting. This is why they included an ""easy mode"". Brilliant.The phone is huge. I have big hands and while it sits comfortably in the palms of my hands most of the time, there are times where single hand use gets a little tricky to reach every corner of the phone. A small sacrifice compared to the great feeling of watching video and playing games and surfing the internet, and my favorite and number one reason for my purchase- the ability to draw on it like a Wacom tablet.Who would love this phone: Tech forward people. People who love tinkering. Artists. People with big hands.Who might not: iPhone diehards, because it's not an iPhone. People with smaller hands because it will at times require the use of (gasp) two hands. I was going to put people that just want something that makes calls and checks email, but the aforementioned ""easy mode"" takes care of that.p.s I got the Flip Cover out of personal preference because the phone is not exactly super thin. I recommend a rubber case, but it will make the phone noticeably thick (IMO)."
Positive,"I bought this phone last December 2012. In the beginning, it worked great and I really loved the phone. I agree about most of positive reviews about this phone *when it is working*.However, after five months of use, the phone suddenly became dead. Specifically, the phone never turned on or got charged. I also tried to do factory reset, but it didn't respond.I wasted hours of research on the internet, and my best informed guess is that it is related to ""Sudden Death Syndrome"". (Search google if you are interested.)I contacted Samsung USA and they refused to repair the phone since it's international (they suggested contacting UK service). Then I contacted Samsung repair service in UK, and it took a long iteration of emails (taking a month) due to their dysfunctional website/email system. Afterwards, I finally received the response (attached below) from them that the phone cannot be repaired in EU since the warranty is in Arab Emirates. What???.....I would not have bought this phone by spending >$600 if I knew that the warranty is based on UAE. The seller was simply dishonest since they never specified these things for product information. It's extremely painful to go through all these customer service, and I wasted way more than $600 worth of time (if calculated based on my business hours).At this point, I almost gave up. I will never buy any phone from this seller, nor any unlocked *international* phone from an unreliable vendor.-----Response from Samsung repair service in UK:""We have checked your devices warranty against the serial number you provided us; we're unfortunately unable to have your device in for repair due to the warranty being outside the EU warranty. The warranty of your device is the United Arab Emirates.If you would like to discuss this further please contact Samsung customer services on 0330 726 7864 then option 6.If you need anything else, please let us know and we'll be happy to help.Thanks for contacting the Samsung repair centre."""
Positive,"Bought the Note 2 in Dec 2012. And on June 20th I charged the phone and came back it was ""off"". Tried to turn it on and NOTHING. Cant reboot do nothing with it. Oh and my phone in GSM International and from the UK. SO I can mail it to them but they CANT mail it back to me. And Samsung US cant fix it because yeah its from the UK. So by Samsung never in my life will I buy a product from them again. Buy at your own risks. If you look up Galaxy S2, S3 Note 2 online you will see that 95% of their owners got the same problem."
Positive,I have now two of them. Because if I lost one I couldn't survive without it!. This is my honest opinion.
Positive,Wonderful: I am enjoying using my Galaxy Note II. All my information is stored in my drop box and can be accessed by my MacBookPro at anytime. I can send and receive picture messages. All I need is my Galaxy Note II and I have everything I need.
Positive,"my husband loves it. the screen is big enough for his poor eyesight ,he wants to bring it anywhere,especially on our travels abroad. but the only thing he hates about it,is he needs to recharge it too often."
Positive,"Love this phone. I felt it was a little big initially, but got used to it. You wont like using a different phone after this. I bought this phone from amazon which i recommend."
Positive,Thanks!
Positive,Good
Positive,Excellent
Positive,Good product
Positive,exelente
Positive,"dont buy it , I buy this and in one years was broked, I loss my money."
Positive,The phone fall on the ground and the screen was broken
Positive,"It's a great phone/tablet so far, but there's just this small problem that bugs me. It doesn't show the date. I clearly selet ""show date and time"" in the setting, but it doesn't show the date at all. I don't know how to fix it. Wonder if anybody out there having the same problem and know how to fix it."
Positive,"The functions and design are perfect.It is very convenient. However, there are some quality problems. I bought it 2 months ago, but it crashes often every day."
Positive,I had to go back to the Samsung store where they told me that the motherboard needs replacing - out of the blue! And they would only do it free of charge if I can produce proof of purchase/warranty. The invoice I have doesn't carry a part# or an REM# and the warranty card was never signed/stamped by the seller.
Positive,"I paid for the phone $640 and used it for 9 months when it stopped working. As I found out FGS Trading doesn't provide any assistance in fixing your phone after 30 days saying that ""I am sorry to hear this, but we never advertise that these phones have warranties. Mobiles do not come with warranty, that is why Best Buy, ATT offer you insurance on them for extra money"" while their website says ""Our product are all brand new, original, factory sealed with their complete accessories. They comes with 1-2 years Warranty from the Manufacturer"" Stay away!!!!"
Positive,"I bought this (new) in the U.S. from FGS Trading (based in Miami) through Amazon. It stopped working (won't turn on)9 months after purchase & FGS Trading & Samsung can not help advise on how to get it repaired. It is under warranty, but Samsung U.S. says they can not help with it's repair or replacement & FGS Trading is offering no assistance even though it sold the product."
Positive,"I ordered this European model unlocked phone at a price I could not match in the US.. Transaction and delivery were smooth. Item was as described. Super easy set up. I just took the SIM card out of my old phone and installed it in my new phone.I had a little trouble using the phone since no manual was included and the phone has a lot of features. My service provider employee at a mall kiosk was helpful with directions and being able to add a chip for extra memory. I like the big screen. Using internet is much easier. Photos seem grainy, but that could be my inexperience. I love some of the pre-installed apps, like being to take photos that look like pencil sketches. My granddaughter loves the pen feature that allows her to draw original pictures. She can take a selfie and put ""make up "" on it."
Positive,Great price and fast shipping the best phone!!!
Positive,This phone is awesome and I love the things you can do with the s pen. Perfect for detail oriented people.
Positive,"This phone is the best phone I have ever had. It is fast, easy to use and is loaded with Samsung's and Google's software packages.. I am using MetroPcs with this phone and it read the SIM card right away and took over my phone number from my prior Verizon account. I have used this phone extensively this past week on the Internet as well as receiving 4GLTE like service (H+).The quad core processor makes this phone a speed demon when connected to wifi. Needlesss to say I am very pleased with this purchase. I also have a Samsung Note 2 8 inch tablet I am also very happy with."
Positive,"If you never try a note, please give it a try. I call this phone a phablet. It does what it is supposed to do. I have had this phone for almost a year and I don't think I will need a new one for a very long time."
Positive,"Since I purchased the phone I had no problems at all, I even go abroad and use my phone with their service provider, no problems at all. The only thing is the phone is a little heavy you need Bluetooth Headsets if you want to talk a little longer."
Positive,"All its good for is to answer the phone and even that's a problem, but all the things a real note 2 is advertised to do, it wontRam is only 512 megs, no S pen ,I went to galaxy store to try S Pen it didn't work. Even the box it came in says the specs.on the box says one thing, however, you look in your settings at internal memory and ram and you'll see it doesn't match.I couldn't even send it back, the address he gave me the Post Master said was not valid and therefore could not send it back.I am very very dissatisfied."
Positive,I bought this phone because I didn't want to contract myself to any company. I also am planning to travel so I wanted one that is easy suitable for SIM cards. This one has two slots for SIM (the european and US). It looks great and I have had it for over a month now and it works awesome. The design is beautiful and screen is huge. Camera is absolutely outstanding! Pictures are sharp and great quality including zoom. I use this phone with Simple mobile company and pay just 40 dollars a month with unlimited everything.Speakers are also very good and so is the music coming out of it. I would recommend it to anyone of my friends. Very happy with my purchase.
Positive,"I am in Pittsburgh and this device could use the T-mobile HSPA+ Network. It's really fast,though LTE is not available."
Positive,"big screen is certainly the catch.My major concern for any Samsung phone is the life of the battery.this battery is good for two days. Consider my wife playing this phoneat lot, it is decent."
Positive,"This phone surpassed my expectations for the first week I've had it. It's bigger than any phone I've ever had but not too cumbersome, especially if you use a headset to make calls. I won't go into all the specs (those have been covered already), but this a great phone."
Positive,"Love everything this phone does. I recommend it to anyone who is creative and wants to record every idea, etc."
Positive,"Love the picture size, the stylus for free hand writing, and the apps available. It exceeds my expectations, and I wouldn't go back to a smaller android phone."
Positive,This product was shipped to me internationaly and worked for three weeks after that wouldnt even turn on supposedly buyers only allow 2 week return policy so now i have a $500 paperweight since it was deemed irrepairable.Telephone repair experts said that it had been wet and didnt even have the little white sticker on that indicates when its wet.
Positive,"Words can NOT express how powerful this phone is. I upgraded from a Galaxy Note 1 International and the 2gb of RAM on Note 2 makes a WORLD of difference. I installed all my old apps that were on my first Galaxy Note, plus Coldfustion's 3D UI which takes up about 300 to 400mb of RAM total itself ( 7 or 10 apps to get the ColdFustion look)I bought my Note 2 used and Unfortunately the seller i bought this from didn't mention a small scratch on the screen that is noticeable any time the screen is off or there is black background behind it... Had i known this, i woulda' paid 50 dollars more for a new one... I'm so in love with the power of Galaxy Note II, that i couldn't mail it back for a refund lolAnd its probably a scratch that will end up there after a few months of owning it myself so at least i saved 50 bucks."
Positive,"It works on Tmobile USA prepaid network. My previous phone is a blackberry and this is my first android. A great platform with lots of customization possible. Love the quart-core processor. Browsing on the web is seamless. Love the alarm functions, calender, organizer, apps and lots more. The phone is large and does not fit all pockets my clothes. I use it for almost everything but call. If you talk a lot on the phone this may be too large for smaller hands (gets uncomfortable if you have to grip it for too long one handed). May not be a phone for everyone but sure is great for me so far."
Positive,Wanted rhis phone as soon asi seen it ITS GREAT SUPER FAST SIZE IS NOT A PROBLEM i upgraded from a iphone 4s rhis blows it away
Positive,"I want let people know about the bug about the phone. so, before you buy think about it!!! I buy this phone 4 months ago, everything is good until one day that phone was totally dead. no any reason just dead. can't turn it on. when I go online check what's going on, I saw a lot people having the same problem. keep searching, I found a message, the life of the phone is about 120-150 days with its EMMC such as a CPU will burn.and the EMMC CPU now is almost out of order, you can guess how many people burn they phone. I bring my phone to samsung store to fix spend $170 to order a new EMMC. when I get there, the technician show me couple same problem phone to me! said"" It is a common problem with samsung galaxy note 2 N7100 and 9300. I was so regret that I buy the second one, which pass 30days, I am sure that will dead again after 3 months. So, trust me, do not buy this!!"
Positive,"Samsung WILL NOT REPAIR THIS PHONE IN THE UNITED STATES. and yet their online support will constantly refer you to a local repair center who will then tell you they only repair carrier-branded devices. I get it's the ""international version"" (despite being the same internally as the US version), but they wouldn't even tell me where I could ship it to overseas to get it repaired.Worst customer service ever and I want to GIVE THEM MONEY lol. Not looking for a warranty repair, I broke my phone and am owning up to it, and they won't help me at all to get it fixed. Just amazes me."
Positive,"This is a very good phone, especially if you need large text for people with bad eye sight. The user interface is very clear and smooth."
Positive,I received the Note with Hungarian instructions. I got on-line and found a complete manual. I downloaded it on a memory stick. It was full speed after I got the sim card from my provider and memory card from my old phone. I love the colors and clarity and the speed is great. I take long trips and needed a smaller computer to keep up with my messages. This little baby will take care of my needs just fine (PLUS its a phone!!) Thanks to all who had anything to do with creating this little jewel.
Positive,I love my note 2 everything about it is awesome... I have the note 1 but the note 2 is a lot better.
Positive,Excelent price/performance. My wife (I bought it for her) loves it!! Almost replaced her tablet and uses mostly this phone and her laptop.
Positive,"Got this phone for my anniversary. Delivery was on time. Phone only worked for 2 weeks then died a sudden death, for no known reason. Contact FGS and they said to send it back but once they got it back that's when they showed the true side to what they do to customers when there is a problem. No help whatsoever. Had to get Amazon involved in order to not loose my entire $519.99 and they arranged for me to get a refund Beware of FGS, they don't care or respect their customers!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Positive,I got this phone brand new although the language was set in Taiwanese but the wall charger was broken but other than that it's an amazing phone
Positive,"The screen is properly big for me,I have Iphone 4S,and I like the screen more than Iphone's because of the size. For the speed,I still like Iphone more than Samsung"
Positive,"The phone works very well, the sound, video and pen are all in good state. The user manual is not in my language, but I didn't ask for that though, and it's fine without the manual."
Positive,"If you live in the USA DON NOT buy this phone, it has been a major pain in the A$$ and it is only a 3G phone!"
Positive,"Updated review: Had the phone for three months, and then it just died without warning. We ordered from Techgiant, a third-party merchant here on Amazon, and they informed us that there was nothing they would do to remedy this (nice, no?). Contacted Samsung, who informed us that since the phone was manufactured in Vietnam, they are not responsible for any warranty within the U.S. We took it to a local cell phone repair shop, and apparently the main board fried....no idea how or why....to the point where they said repairing it would be cost prohibitive. Contacted Amazon, and God bless them, they gave us a partial refund as an effort to lessen our heartache.My wife still loves the phone, so we're going to get an unlocked version through Staples, and we will buy a warranty through them as well. We would buy directly from Amazon instead, but they only sell this through third-party merchants. We will pay about $100 more that we would online just for the phone, but the peace of mind we'll have getting it through a reputable company makes it worth the extra cost.If you read all of the reviews, you'll see our experience is not unique. So, purchasing this phone online, through a third-party vendor, is a gamble. If you choose to roll the dice, I hope you have better luck than we did. I felt obliged to update this review to let you know of our very bad experience so maybe you can avoid having to go through something similar.Original review:My wife was tethered to T-Horrible by a contract for several years, which we finally broke away from....with a penalty, of course. It was worth it. They treat their customers like dirt.We then switched to Virgin Mobile, which didn't work out so well either due to bad connectivity and bad customer service (but not as bad as T-Horrible, by any means...the main issue was being on hold for an hour to speak to someone in India, and usually subsequently getting disconnected). Plus, at least with the Virgin plan, we were not bound to a contract....something we vowed to not repeat if possible.We bought this Samsung phone and switched over to Straight Talk, and couldn't be happier. Connectivity is great, as is their customer service (so far).We ordered a micro SIM card with the AT&T format. Even going with their higher priced unlimited $45 per month no-contract plan, I figure it will take about a year in savings as compared to a contract plan to break even on what I paid for the phone.We contacted Straight Talk and made it clear that she wanted to keep her old number. We were told it could take a day or two to process everything and make the switch. Well, that was wrong....it took about an hour! We ordered the 30-day unlimited plan and the SIM card online from their website, and it arrived the next day (the had a special offer for free overnight shipping).My wife's only complaint about the phone itself is how complex it is; it takes some time to learn everything it can do and how to make adjustments (e.g., why is it making that noise every now and then?). It really is an amazing device....the screen clarity and all the options it offers will blow you away!If things change, I will update the review, but right now we are very happy with our decision to go with this phone and with Straight Talk as a service provider."
Positive,good and it think that it is very useful and my mother was very happy when she saw this phone
Positive,"It is the best cellphone I have. I recommand it. It is a little expensive, but it is worth this price."
Positive,clean and in good order. I really love it.
Positive,excelent
Positive,Perfect. Thanks.
Positive,A+
Positive,I like it
Positive,Highly recommend; product as described and timely shipment. Thanks so much!
Positive,"it is not a original phone it is a chinnese copy, dot buy this phone, you can't use this phone anywhere on the world"
Positive,"this is like the U.S. version, I didn't notice any difference, amazing phone, recommended if your eyes are tired from the ""little screen"" smartphones in the market,"
Positive,"The phone was described as an international version GT-N7100, but most of the parts were of the korean version of E250s, hence It didn't pick most of the networks as the 7100 should. Seller was stubborn, and insist that I didn't know what I was talking about. I work in IT, and have repair a bunch of computers,phones, iPads, etc all over the years. an 7100 should pick these frequencies: GSM (2G): 850/900/1800/1900, UMTS (3G) HSDPA 850 / 900 / 1900 / 2100, the korean version only supported HSDPA on 1900/2100.. so It didn't work with the carriers I use 850/900. Beware and double check the version of the phones you intend to buy before you do it."
Positive,"I bought this when it came out. I liked the phone but after it stopped working i was not able to do anything. I contacted Amazon, the seller, nothing.I contacted Samsung US because i live in US, they did not do anything because it is international model manufactured in England or India. They gave me phone # to call after many phone calls. India number was very weird so I contacted Samsung UK. People were very nice but deflected me to some web site UK and said they do not accept packages from abroad. So i sent it to my mom in EU. She send it then to UK. And even though Samsung's manufacturers warranty is 2 years they did not fix my phone! Even though it was less than 1 year old. Anyways they all toss it around like a hot potato. I thought it is Samsung - meaning every official Samsung branch i take it to should take my phone and fix it even if they have to ship it to China! What is manufacturer's warranty? Nothing?"
Positive,"I recommend the customers do not buy this cell phone. This cell phone is the worst I have bought. Inside of one year of guarantee the cell phone did not work, at 7 months. I called amazon, but they never were responsible for the guarantee. I called the seller, but they didn't take responsibility of the cell phone. I called to UK where is located the headquarters, but they never take responsibility of its guarantee. Finally I have throw it to the garbage. I lost $ 650 dollars in 7 months.That is too bad."
Positive,"This is the first review I've ever done on any product and I am writing this to warn others that Samsung does not honor their warranty on unlocked phones. Last December I purchased an unlocked Samsung Galaxy Note II from Amazon through Worldwide Distributors. The phone worked fine for 9 months up until September. Then without warning, the phone simply died. It was not the battery and the phone was never dropped, nor exposed to water nor any other hazards. There was not even a scratch on the phone. It was completely dead with no lights or sounds and it was not the battery. Worldwide Distributors won't help you after 90 days so I contacted Samsung. After first being directed to Samsung U.S. in Texas, who told me that it was a Latin American version so they couldn't help me, they directed me to Samsung in Panama, who told me that it was actually a U.K. version. Samsung U.K. was also of absolutely no help. Bottom line, I paid $642.00 for a brand new phone that Samsung refuses to even look at, will not repair, not exchange nor refund even though the product is still under warranty even as I write this. I have had several hours of conversations and numerous emails including with various managers and even contacted Samsung corporate who all refused to help saying that it was ""not economically viable"" to repair, refund or replace their defective product. I will never buy another Samsung product ever again and write this review solely as a warning to others that if you buy an unlocked version of a Samsung phone, they will not honor their warranty if the phone should fail and you will essentially be throwing your money away. Feel free to contact me if you wish."
Positive,"I really loved being an iphone user and have always respected both apple and android for their efforts in bringing us the best choice possible in technology. I decided to make the jump when I found out that the new iphone wouldn't be changing the screen size proportionally. Oh Apple, why did you think lengthening the screen without widening it was a good idea?So I decided to make the jump to android after realizing my want for a bigger screen couldn't be satisfied anymore staying with the iphone. The iphone is still great, still my top choice for usability, android is catching up tho.This phone is awesome for the screen size. I love it, even tho I have a Nexus 4 and put this one aside for a bit I'm back to using it full time. I can't explain how odd it is going from this to a smaller sized screen. It's just weird.My only complaint is this and really any phone that isn't a google phone will take ages for the manufacturers to update. I think they could do much better especially with their flagship devices. I guess that's what the custom rom scene is great for...."
Positive,"The best phone I ever have! I spent months speculating on what phone to buy. I chose between S3, Iphone 5 then when the note 2 debut! I had no second thoughts!"
Positive,"Really love the new Note 2. The Screen and camera are really great. The size it's not a big deal, as a mater of fact I love the size. It's easy to switch from the Note to my Asus Transformer when I need more screen size."
Positive,"If you are on the fence about purchasing the¬†Samsung Galaxy Note II N7100 Unlocked GSM International Version White, rest assured that you will be getting what I dear say is the most advanced phone/tablet on the market to date. What are the features of this phone? What can it do? It may actually be easier to tell you what it can't do.I've had lots of different makes and models of cell phones over the years, including Blackberry and Iphone but I dear say that this is by far the best phone that I've ever owned, it has way more features than I may ever actually use. The Samsung Galaxy Note II makes the great Iphone seem very BORING in comparison.This being the international version, I initially had a little trouble with getting Apps from the Samsung Apps Store, every time I tried I got an Error Message that was basically stating that the Samsung Apps was registered in one Country and my Samsung account was from another country so I was unable to get any Apps for the Samsung Apps Store. (If you are having the same problem, just let me know and I'll help you fix the issue).The level of customization on this phone is simply amazing, I know that you will happy with this purchase, unless you have an issue with the size, let's face facts this is a big phone but it is by far the best out there, a total beast when it comes to processing power.P.S. I must make mention of this just to let you know happened when I made my purchase so you can take precaution when making yours.I purchased my Samsung Galaxy Note II form a seller known as ""Techno.Trading.House"" but was fulfilled by Amazon. When I received the package, there were no seals on the box, there should be a seal on each side, it should also have a plastic film on the screen as well as the back of the phone, but the one on the back was missing and there was minor scratches on the back of the phone.When I took the plastic film off of the screen there were finger prints all over and the battery was not in a plastic bag as it was supposed to be, taking all of these things into consideration, it lead me to believe that someone opened this box and placed the battery into the phone probably out of curiosity, whatever the reason, someone clearly TAMPERED with my phone scratching the back cover in the process.When I checked the log it showed that the phone was in use for over 5.5 minutes, apart from this, the phone seems to be in perfect working condition with no scratches on the screen whatsoever.My advice to you is to purchase from Amazon or from a seller whose product is fulfilled by Amazon in order for you to be covered by Amazon.When Amazon heard of my issue, they apologized for what happened and told me that products from other sellers that are fulfilled by them is from the sellers stock, and they promptly offered me a full refund so I can re-order, which I thought was great on their part, Amazon always like to see their customer be happy with their purchase.I told Amazon that I don't think that a full refund was necessary in this case as the phone works great otherwise so they offered my a 20% refund for the condition in which I received the phone, this I accepted as I consider this fair for all.PLEASE be careful who you purchase from, these phones are not cheap in any way, if you were to look at ""Techno.Trading.House"" seller's profile & feedback rating you will see mostly 5 star ratings which may give a false sense of security, make sure that your purchase is covered by Amazon for your peace of mind."
Positive,The title says it all. This is simply an amazing phone. If you have medium sized or large hands it is not at all to big.I am not going to repeat all the other reviews: It is simply an amazing phone!
Positive,I am an iPhone convert thank to this one. The shackles have been lifted and android is great. The phone is big and if you are good with that - then you found your ideal mobilish companion. Got it with Polish as the default language (I guess the International version) and customized it to my needs. Great machine.
Positive,Simply put. A powerful cellular phone capable of performing functions of a tablet. I think it is the best phone ever produced to date. I won't be surprised if Apple would follow this trend.
Positive,Love the phone and shipping was fast. Will Defintinly order from this seller again. The only thing I hate is it doesn't come with a 64GB internal harddrive but its not a deal breaker. Otherwise really great phone.
Positive,"this is a great phone. the size is a non-issue. in fact it's necessary for note taking with the device having a stylus.. err S-Pen as one of the main reasons i considered this phone. Everything about this phone feels different from all the androids I've tried. I chose this over the nexus 4 and i don't regret it. it's not perfect however. here are some of the things that could be improved:1. phone needs to switch the menu button with the back button. almost all androids have it the other way i don't know why samsung put the back button on the right side. this is especially problematic when writing notes with the S-pen and my hand keeps hitting the back button.2. If you like the read aloud feature of google books, you have to turn on the talkback feature and disable airview (the feature that lets the s-pen communicate with the phone before it touches the screen. this isn't too hard but it's still 2 extra steps compared to my previous nexus where the read aloud is just 1-2 clicks away; no need to play with the accessibility settings.3. S-note doesn't let you zoom into the page so you can write more. Handy Note and Antipaper Notes does this well.4. touchwiz is feature rich and i love it but it doesn't conform with android's holo theme which is more sophisticated looking5. if you enjoy video maker in note 1, it's missing in note 2 for some reason. they replaced it with ""video editor"" in the samsung apps market but it's not exactly the same. it removed the ability to edit and annotate the video with s-pen input.6. google music widget is ugly while the samsung media player (widget) doesn't work with google music at all.7. changing the wallpaper takes too many steps.8. they need to improve the calendar app. the widget doesn't show the S-pen marks. and i heard samsung calendar doesn't sync with google calendar. not sure about that.9. image search syncs with images in dropbox but not google picasa. that was a big disappointment to me. there were so many times i wanted to pull out some image from my google photos and it only shows me the ones in my phone and in my dropbox account.the positives:1. the S-Pen is awesome and can be used in many ways. this is a stylus-centric OS.2. screen is big and beautiful3. FASSSST. no lags. i can do anything. 2 GB RAM!!4. battery life is great. 1 1/2 day for typical users and 1 day for power users.5. you get 50gb of dropbox storage for free (for 2 yrs).6. works with google voice.7. syncs with facebook contacts8. click ""add shortcut to home"" for your favorite contacts and put them in one folder, it's like a speed dial! there's also actual speed dial. samsung handled the address book well.9. 2 wonderful unique ways to type: one is using the s-pen and swyping with it and second is text recognition when you write with the s-pen or just your finger. it's not perfect but it's awfully accurate. most of my problems with it is it capitalizes when it's not supposed to but the letters are usually correct.10. scrapbooking! i have installed flicker, ebay, 500px, Fancy and Pinterest so i can search and clip items to be put in my scrapbook. discover wonderful s-pen apps like comicbook, flipaclip, paper artist, photo desk, photo editor, sketchbook, notes on life and papyrus. try the game sudoku with s-pen input. these are all s-pen specialized apps.11. you'll love evernote with this phone. also try catch.12. ChatOn is a wonderful chat program that's cross platform but with the S-pen you can do a lot more with animated messages and edited images from your scrapbook. you can even record what you're doing in your screen with the right productivity apps. e-mail and messaging are more powerful with the s-pen.3. accessories: the moga controller, the samsung dongle, the all powerful dock, a slew of nice cases (if the note 1 was any indication).so although i would be unhappy that this won't prob. get instant updates from google, this is however a version i can get stuck with for 2 yrs. touchwiz isn't too bad and you can't go wrong with 2GB of RAM."
Positive,"perfect, I like it! I want to buy other one. I bought Note 2 White, it look very beautiful ! it from factory Samsung."
Positive,"Ordered with 1-3 day expedited shipping. Delivered the very next day. Brand new, in Samsung's sealed packaging.Looks like it's imported from France or was destined for the french market, since the startup wizard had the default language set to french.The phone is really light for it's size, and the battery life is superb. 2 days running on the out-of-box charge of about 60%, with moderate web, youtube, email and call usage.Skype works great with the front camera. The stylus is cool! Takes some getting used to, not just the stylus, even the device and android jelly bean with samsung mods as a whole, with all the shortcuts and movement gestures. Samsung does a lot of innovation, and it shows here.. whether you are an Apple fan or not or don't care.4G works, not yet tested the network data speeds. Voice quality is better than my previous iPhone 4, probably many factors involved in that.You will need to buy a micro SDHC or SDXC card, preferably before starting to use the device, since this one does not come by default with a card."
Positive,"As an owner of the original Galaxy Note, let me just start by saying most of the issues or ""annoyances"" felt in version 1 have been ironed out in version 2.Everything is better with the Note 2. The speed of this thing is awesome. Windows fly open with easy and smoothness, faster screen switching and all around a more solid feel in the operating system. It is hard to describe. I highly recommend just playing with one at the stores and you will instantly feel its awesomeness.Love the extra features, multi-tasking (although I hope future versions support all apps), better S Note capabilities and touch/feel. This thing takes stunning photos and videos. Love all the new photo add-ons....voice activating the shot by saying ""Cheese!"" is killer. Photo buffs will love all the new Android 4.1 features.Everything shown on the screen is literally breathtaking. All my friends are jealous when I show it to them. Take that tiny iPhone! Battery life is awesome, my biggest complaint regarding the Note 1.Note: Rooting! I rooted my phone, but user beware. If you root this phone, mine stopped getting updates via Kies and the phone's update system. I had to get download of the latest international firmwares, and install it manually. Not hard, and ensures you are always up to date. If doing this, make sure you write down your current Baseband and Build number in Settings/About Device section and get the latest available build that matches the country code. Google it. I highly recommend backing up your current ROM/firmware if you do any rooting.Love the phone....wish it was cheaper, but well worth the money and upgrade from the Note 1. Highly recommend it!"
Positive,"Omg, this phone is the most beautiful electronic! It has made me fall in love again. It makes me think and feel, what iphoney!? If everyone could just get their hands on one of these babies!!!!! As long as Samsung keeps doing what it does on their products.. I will ALWAYS keep on being a Samung customer. I will never go back to any other brands as long as more notes II keep coming out!!!!!!"
Positive,"I just recently purchased this phone and all I can say is wow! I am never bored with it and I cant seem to put it down. there is no end to its functionality. I never played games on any of my previous devices but now the large screen makes me enjoy playing games(currently addicted to CK Zombies). It is also good for viewing and editing documents, you would have to download Polaris from the Samsung store or any other document viewing app you prefer."
Positive,"I ordered the Note 2 on Sunday night, received the item on Tuesday night. The phone works perfect, box still got seal and everything is brand new. Highly recommended seller!"
Positive,The galaxy note 2 has to be the best phone every created. I love being able to use the multitasking sucks though that not alot of apps support that function yet though. The battery life is amazing and can take my heavy pounding all day long. The fast charging is no joke its fast. The s pen function that is supposed to beep and vibrant when you leave the pen out and walk away does not work well at all though. The phone can run a littke hot because its a quad core but that's not also a big deal breaker. There is a led light on the top left of the device so you will know when you have a notification. I am not going to root this phone it does not need it like all other phones.
Positive,This is a big phone. But makes up for its bulk with its functionality. Android makes it very user friendly. I love it!!
Positive,"The Samsung Galaxy Note 2 International Version totally met expectations. I was looking for an unlocked phone to pair with a MVNO service. This fit the bill easily and with a few minor tweaks, with help of customer service was able to enjoy voicemail, H+ data (i.e. 3G plus), texting and voice service at a fraction of the monthly price. Another great thing about this phone is that it allows tethering. Just make sure your MVNO allows this too.As for the functionality of the phone itself, you won‚Äôt get 4G data, but I was able to achieve 3G Plus (H+) with my carrier. I also noticed phone call quality to be much better than any phone I‚Äôve ever had. Voices seem to be devoid of the treble hiss you‚Äôll get on other phones. As for the display, it‚Äôs my first AMOLED display phone. I noticed, blacks to be very black and primary colors to be very vivid, especially reds. As for the smoothness of the phone (processor speed) If you have 8 or 9 apps running at once, you might notice some hiccups especially with scrolling, but if you run less than 8 (from what I saw) you‚Äôll have buttery smooth scrolling. Overall, I am extremely satisfied and just love the huge 5.5‚Äù screen."
Positive,I have had it for a week and just about to give up using my iPad. The only problem is its use of a MICRO SIM. I chose to use a MVNO (PTEL.COM) they send ONLY a MINI SIM. Finding a way to cut to size was a problem. (Problem of my own making not the Note2.)
Positive,"So far, the best Phablet or small tablet-phone to date. This year, will se all new stuff similar to the Note 2, thanks to this succesfull gadget. I'm very happy with it. Fast, accurate, impressive battery life, and well constructed phone."
Positive,"Satisfa√ß√£o total, recebi dentro do prazo, com condi√ß√µes perfeitas de embalagem. Estou amando o celular, funcionando plenamente inclusive com operadoras do Brasil"
Positive,"The phone is looks exactly new! the seller send it right after I leave the message~~Thank you very much! love it, Hope to trade with you again if have a chance!"
Positive,"Fantastic phone;If the size is what's keeping you from buying this phone, don't think about it for one more second.Blazing Hardware, Jelly Bean, Neat little stylus, Non-Pentile OLED Display, the list goes onOne thing to consider if you're going the prepaid provider route specifically T-Mobile (which I assume you might be since you're purchasing an unlocked phone) is the phone's supported frequencies. T-Mobile is currently in the process of upgrading their towers to from 1700mhz to 1900mhz, depending on where you live you may be stuck with dreadfully slow speeds if the upgrades haven't taken place yet.Aside from that, I'm totally smitten with this phone."
Positive,"This phone came already jail broken, and takes great pictures. Love the large screen, only wish it had a place for the stylus pen."
Positive,"Device is really great, best one if you are looking for something with a good screen size. I strongly recommend it."
Positive,I've been using this phone for about a week and so far I'm LOVING IT!! it soooooo different from any other phones i've used and honestly speaking i think this phone is better then Iphone..... but thats my opinion since i did use an iphone before this. The seller was greatttt and shipped on time and the phone is in perfect condition. OMG im so happy~~~ i would recommend this to ANYONE and EVERYONE! .....Well to those who don't mind big phones!
Positive,"Me encata mi galaxy es muy bueno , se los recomiendo esta liberado y lo puedo utilizar aqui en venezuela"
Positive,Not to complain. Really the better phone I got already!I did even some reviews on Youtube... but there are many there!
Positive,"Excellent 'phoneblet'. Does everything you will need in a phone, and a tablet, given the size and easy portability, compared to carrying a tablet around."
Positive,"No doubt way better than the iPhone.never gets dull.i have no regrets changing from iOS to android.love the screen size.u get more real estate plus the ability to customize ur Samsung phone.the apps are great too.and since I have the international version I am planning to use this phone when I travel abroad,which I do a lot during the year.eye catcher.and it's not really that hard to carry and use.the s pen is also a plus.simply enjoyed using it.had no problems at all.and yes apple..size does matter.lol.i have a feeling apple will start making these 5 inch screen phones too.wtg Samsung."
Positive,i bought this cel for gift to my wife and she was impacted!!is an experience from out of worldthanks a lot
Positive,"I am still learning how to use him... I am so in love with this Samsung. It's light, functional, fast, great camera. Can't be compared to an apple.... It's just much better than it! It's the perfect combination of a tablet and a smartphone. Congratulations, Samsung!"
Positive,I'm going to be specific this phone is the best of the best from samsung. I'm a fanatic from other brands but this is the best that i been have. The high quality of this cellphone have the value of every cent you pay for it.
Positive,"Great smartphone, I guess the best I've had. The seller answered my questions and it arrived when expected. Everything great, nothing to complain."
Positive,"I've owned HTC phone, Nokias, iphones and most recently I owned an SIII, but the screen seemed to always get in the way of a great handheld experience. The Note 2 fulfills my requirements and surpasses a lot of my expectations. There is no lag to speak of when switching between apps, it runs smoothly and fluidly. I have run graphic intensive applications on here and the phone doesn't get that hot either. The battery is nice and big and the power management is pretty awesome. I have to charge this phone once every 24 hours after watching over an hour of video and listening to music and web browsing and facebooking.This may only be true of the international unlocked version though which is no inundated with the carrier bloatware that they force to run in the background to monitor activity."
Positive,"Best phone that I have used so far!Great processor, memory, spectacular display, camera, and OS to boot!Samsung makes good quality phones!"
Positive,"This phone is great but sellers are misleading or not informing you that this phones WILL not work on US LTE networkscurrentlyAT and T uses frequency 700/1700 Bands 4/17 AWST-Mobile uses frequency 1700/1900 Band 4/25 AWSMetroPCS uses frequency 1700/1900 Bands 4/25 AWSEdit 05/28/2013T-Mobile started their At&T compatible 3G service,my At&T out of contract iPhone 4 works on 3G using a T-Mobile simearlier -till end of April-it worked only on EDGEso this phone should work on 3G on At&T and T-Mobilestill it wont work on LTEso in a nutshell, if you are ok with 3G service? this phone is ok on both GSM networks in USA I don't get this coverage in my area and cant even get online if not at home and now (world wide distributors) is giving me a hassle to send it back for a refund. also the phone service i paid for to get 4g is wasting away till i can get the correct phone to run on the LTE/4G bands that are the only available in my area WORLDWIDE DISTRIBUTORS also kept 92 dollars of my refund I will be getting the 4g/lte version from SHOPEBEST for 10 dollars more"
Positive,Have no problems with this phone whatsoever. It handles anything you throws at it. Samsung best so far. Good buy!
Positive,"It was good money spent, do not regret my purchase, phone is up to my expectatives. Will recommend to any one"
Positive,"My previous phone was a Samsung Galaxy Ace and I have seen my wife's phone Samsung Galaxy S1. I needed the phone especially for work and all my stuff is around the google environment. My Note II works really well, it is small and bign enough, i got all the apps I need, the battery works really well,..., Great!"
Positive,"Well, that's what my wife said to me when I gave it to her! I also have one and I have to say... I LOVE IT! LOVE IT! LOVE IT! =>"
Positive,Perfect !it is very fast and smart .the battery life is great. The screen size is perfect for me. Love It !
Positive,Delighted to have this product. Its a brilliant combination of phone and tablet capability with state of art features. Very happy!
Positive,even my bosses who are loyal to everything Apple have switched to this phone. very easy to use and very convenient.
Positive,"The directions for inserting the SIM card were unclear. Subsequently I damaged the phone trying to insert the SIM card. The distributor suggested that I should get in touch with the manufacturer. However, because it is an international phone, Samsung US will have nothing to do with it. They first directed me to Samsung Canada. But Samsung Canada also wants nothing to do with it. If I type my model number into Google, I come up with Samsung UK. I am still trying to connect with Samsung UK. All that I would like is to get a phone that works. I am willing to pay for service, as it was, no doubt, my fault. Maybe Amazon can help?"
Positive,"I have only used the phone for a few days. I have an old samsung galaxy tab 7 as a phone and upgraded to this. Jelly Bean is much better than gingerbread and this phone is very responsive. I actually bought an Asus Transformer TF700 at the same time and after using this phone, I doubt I will be reaching for the tablet much even though they both use the same OS. I find this phone much more convenient to carry around, the screen size is great for reading still, and the apps seem to be much more repsonsive."
Positive,"This phone is simply good. My ONLY reservation about this product is it came with a Romanian manual. Therefore, it's bit perplexing initially. However, there is an option for English during the phone setup. So it's fine in the end. Thank you."
Positive,There is no galaxy inside the inner box.(galaxy box)there was no sticker on the box and the box was opened!what the hell is this??
Positive,Allows me do everything i want to do. I am very happy with my purchase and recomend this phone to everyone
Positive,I chose this rating because the phone was taking to Samsung store and was proved to be fake and thedelivery time was far overdue. And have returned but have not still got my refund yet. I will definitely not recommend it to anybody.
Positive,"there's no sim for this phone . don't buy it . I bought 1 . Sent home for my brother [ viet nam ] . he can not use it over there . because , no sim"
Positive,"This works great with my schedule, for pictures, and just using it every day as a telephone. It was worth it."
Positive,excellent phone the best i ever had so far
Positive,"I love it! What can I say, I bought two!"
Positive,"I received the charging cable for the phone, thanks"
Positive,good
Positive,"Came on time with box properly sealed. phone works great, no complaints. i love that everything was white. Headset, charger, data cable. Great battery life and it charges super fast. definitely a great phone."
Positive,"This is my first time using Note II, it's easier to operate and so good to open and reading a webpage. Think I will use it for a long time."
Positive,"There's not from Samsung, I only found 2 can peel off label which shows Samsung (fake), although turn on the phone, not show Samsung, no water unlock screen, no S Pen app or other Samsung app. Case size like same as Samsung Note, but no Samsung on front and peel off label on back. Seller TechWorld101 only sent RNA label for me to return, but no return shipping label, there's a loss and that's not my fault to pay for it. I'll take more pictures to show that's not from Samsung, and take video to pack for return, wish I can get full refund. I purchased a lot of good stuff from Amazon, but can't trust to buy phone again."
Positive,I JUS LOVE IY!!!! IT IS THE BEST MOBILE (PHABLET) I EVER HAD!!! IT HAS A VERY GOOD CAMERA WITH GOOD RESOLUTIONS ON PICTURES.
Positive,"http://youtu.be/3q8VKnWeFTwThis is my phone function, but, Go4computers, seller for this product, said this is fully functioned !Is this looks okay? OMG!!!!!!!!!!!!I purchased Galaxy note 2 at Amazon, the seller was Go4computers.As you can see, S-Pen is not working properly. however, they said there is no problem to this phone and turn off 'air view' function. Is this common sense? I paid fully in order to use fully functioned phone !"
Positive,"I love that phone, big~ and it very easy to use... iam not iphone fans... but differently better than Iphone.."
Positive,its great i love the apps the speed of the the phone this device it good for a person like me Tech
Positive,"excelente telefono, super recomendado y el servicio brindado por el provedor tambien muy bueno. lo recomiendo ampliamente no tuve problema para activarlo en mexico"
Positive,that was disappointing except that everything else was good.International phones does not support 3G/4g/LTE speed in USA which is disappointing. I brought from Amazon only because I was not getting while color anywhere in USA. After 4 weeks in use my phone does not work with any wireless network. Tried resetting 2 times with a huge waste in time and effort. Wish I would have gone for Apple iphone 5.
Positive,Been using the ohone for 2 months now and wow. words cant describe how cool this is. The screen is hugh and using gps and hiigh end apps makes the phone experience overwhelming
Positive,"I love this Mobile so much as it is more than my expectation. It's features are amazing and it's speed is extremely high. Sensors are too brilliant and I enjoy it. Screen is very good and u can watch, read, write confortably. Air view using S-Pen (stylus) is pretty cool."
Positive,They are very nice and good thank you
Positive,I love it a good phone
Positive,I love it. . As good as brand new... express delivery
Positive,"I have quite a lot of experience buying flagship smartphones and I have never had such an experience with any other flagship.This phone kept failing on me, sometimes the screen stopped working and it wouldn't turn on, sometimes the speakers stopped working and sometimes the phone stopped charging and all of this within a three month period and most of the times when I took it to the repair center they said that it's not covered under the warranty and I ended up paying a lot for the repairs.I wouldn't recommend anyone buying a flagship from this company as it's not worth the price and the customer service is not reliable.I ended up throwing this phone away."
Positive,Best battery life I have ever seen in a phone. Still over 50% battery life when my Nokia and iPhone are completely dead. I hope that this phone proves to be as reliable as my Nokia and iPhone. I will keep you updated.
Positive,Excelents
Positive,good
Positive,Excellent
Positive,"I ordered this phone for someone when I got it, to put in the sim card and memory card the slot for the cards was loose and falling out, I had to hold the slot to put in the cards, and right now the screen is white I cant see anything on it, it started with a white faded spot on the bottom right corner and after time it started to spread all over until I cannot see anything. I know I took long because I normally don't do reviews but the owner told me to do that so I just want to let the public know that the phone I got was a used one, please be aware of the seller"
Positive,Highly recommended!!! A+++
Positive,this is good item
Positive,"Lovely phone, delivered excellently. Packaged so well and safe to insure safe delivery. I am so pleased. I will buy more. Very vast delivery."
Positive,love it..
Positive,I love it works perfect
Positive,"I am with Tmobile and bought this for my son. It was easy to unlock it following a YouTube video illustration. Referbushed like new phone works great. Not a single scratch was found. It came with no original box but included all accessories except earphones, which I bought separately. I love the stylis for this AT&T phone. It's much cuter that the Tmobile one."
Positive,"I love it , so thanks."
Positive,I love the phone. Does so much more than the iphone 5 love the size as well. I love the split screen feature. To me the phone is just plain awesome.
Positive,"Great service from the seller, great product quality. love this phone and all its features."
Positive,Phone sucked! Had to send it back.
Positive,Love it and I thank you for the phone & services....
Positive,The galaxy Samsung note II cell phone white/ gray . My husband and I are please with the out come. They look like knew. Thanks for used cell phones. We are loving it!! :-)
Positive,Good condition as advertised. Nice.
Positive,Came perfect! A few minor scratches but not noticable.I recommend this for anyone switching from apple to Samsung.
Positive,I am so frustrated with this phone you guys send me. I emailed the place that mailed it to me. I had this phone for only a month and the battery is already dieing fast. My phone will be 100% when I leave home at 7:40 and by 11:30 my phone is on 40%. I don't use my phone at work so I don't understand. I make sure all my apps are close and my light is dim. Then the phone did not come with the original charger. It look like a charger from a camera. It is very frustrating. There is always a stop for the Internet then the phone will shut off at 30%. This is ridiculous.
Positive,Phone works great. Was just as described
Positive,Nice phone just loved it
Positive,Didn't work long. Won't get another ever.
Positive,My battery goes dead real fast even with power save on
Positive,Didnt work. Phone was locked. I thought this could hv bn avoided had the seller actually checked before shipping.
Positive,So far so good. I am pleased with it so far. I was worried it being used by I really looked good.
Positive,I am in love with this. It came with the charger. It has no scratches or nothing. It is in tip top shape and works great.
Positive,Looked brand new. Loaded with lots of Applications. Intstalled SIM. Works perfectly. Only complaint no owner's manual. Now have a decent phone for a no contract monthly plan.
Positive,The phone was in extremely good condition my nephew love the screen size and the speed the phone operates at.
Positive,"Works great, but came with a defective battery.The supplier immediately sent a new one without question and one that works well."
Positive,clean and just like new
Positive,"Phone came flawless. Absolutely amazed by it. I was worried about it being way to big because i have small hands, but its perfect size. Huge screen. Takes amazing picture, both front and back camera. I recommend this for everyone!!‚ò∫"
Positive,Not very satisfied. Phone has some image issues when loading images from web. Already contacted seller and will be returning product
Positive,love it
Positive,the phone is locked and only call emergency calls but was contacted by wesell and they were so kind to help me solve my problem with instructions to unlock phone
Positive,"the most awesome smart phone around, it dose everything you need and more, and such an amazing price of $49.00 and so easy to use."
Positive,"easy to use, good product! better than i thought. like this cell phone very much. i've use it for 1 month, and it works well."
Positive,Another excellent Samsung phone. It is pretty much what is advertized now if we could fix - at&t - it would be great.
Positive,She wanted a new phone despite getting an HTC One VX only a few months ago. Got her this and moved her phone to her Mother who is on our family plan and everyone is happy. Not a cool as My note 3 but more affordable for her. Both are now happy.
Positive,I love this phone it has amazing response time several useful preloaded apps like s note s voice and many more not to mention the s pen is more ergonomically fit than the original note design
Positive,"this phone is huge I love how big it is, also it does everything you could imagine to do with a phone it is a little computer in my pocket. I would recommend it to everyone!!"
Positive,my phone has very helpful features. I love the camera and how I can multi-task. great phone to have for work or pleasure.
Positive,everything is great and can't really elaborate on this product any more than what all the other reviews out there have said.
Positive,"This phone is just awesome except that the audio quality for voice calls is not up to the mark. Luckliy I have other phones that I can use for that. Other than that, I love it completely. The stylus works great. The word guide while typing is a great help. Many more awesome features.I am glad I made this choice."
Positive,"This phone is amazing! Samsung makes some great products! I love all the features, especially the larger screen! I purchased a nice fold case for it so it's like a wallet. I love the S Pen! Use it all the time! My husband who does not use a cell even expressed an interest in using the phone. He loves being able to use the voice commands & of course the larger screen! All in all, I haven't found anything that I don't like about phone."
Positive,Amazing no problem
Positive,I received it within the stipulated time and in the described form.
Positive,Awesome
Positive,Excelente
Positive,"Awesome, fast service. Phone was just as described, very pleased."
Positive,Great product
Positive,Order this Note II for a friend and she loves it so far. Only has had it for a couple of days but is what she wanted.
Positive,All i can say is that i already had the galaxy but i wanted the galaxy gear watch and the galaxy phone i had didn't have jelly beans to make it work !!! So then I bouth this one and I love it they connected right away and its so much fun lol .... the new phone was a great price and i couldn't pass it up ...... Thank you .......
Positive,I am completely happy with my new phone!! It does more things than I knew and it is wonderful to use!!!
Positive,"Good phone , att is a little high on there coverage. But 99 was a heck of a deal to start the contract"
Positive,This phone is amazing. Great for the 50 year old eyes. Lolol. Everyone thinks it is to big but let me tell you it is perfect.
Positive,"I love this phone! It does everything right. All the other androids I've owned I always rooted and installed aftermarket roms but I don't feel like I need to with this phone. AT&T is ok, better than Sprint but not as good a Verizon but it'll suffice."
Positive,"This phone is everything I wanted it to be and more. At first I thought the size would be too big, but I love the big screen and it's very light weight. It is also super easy to use. There are so many functions that I haven't even learned yet. It is fun to continue to learn more new things about my phone."
Positive,Best phone ever...LOVE IT!!!! Too big...? that would be a crazy statement...never too big. The features are amazing! I recommend it to everyone...each time I get a Compliment
Positive,The phone is absolutely marvelous! It has a bigger screen and more RAM than the first note. It has a lot of updates that I admire in this phone. The note II has an answer to the iPhone's siri and it blows them out of the water. I just learned that Samsung is coming out with the Note III in November 2013. I can't wait to see what the note III has.
Positive,"Love the big screen: the size didn't bother me; I always wanted a bigger screen. And once you go big, the smaller aka regular size screen just seemed so confining and comically dwarfish.Love the S pen: I can draw quite well on there. It all depending on the correct apps (autodesk is what I use). Everytime I took out the pen, S note popped up: very useful when taking note while calling or just to jot down stuffs.Love the multitask feature: surfing for TED videos on youtube while GPS navigating! searching internet while watching netlfix!!! surfing internet while reading news!!! I can't get over how much I craved for this feature for so long and never even realized it. This feature is just begging for the bigger screen ;-)I have the Xperia X10 for quite a while, so a lot of the features that I love might be common on android phones in general."
Positive,"Some people may complain about the fact that it's ""only"" 720p, but seriously, my wife has the S4, and when we compare them side by side, you can't see a difference unless you're about 2 inches from the screen. This phone/tablet is absolutely amazing and has become invaluable to me for work and school. I'm using it constantly and the battery life is absolutely amazing! i've eve got it overclocked to 1.9GHz from the original 1.6GHz and the battery still gets me through an entire day with ease. The screen size if AMAZING! I don't think I can ever go back to a phone with a smaller screen again. When you first get it, it does feel rather large in your hand, but you get used to it in about a day or two tops and then everything else seems really small and almost like a toy. I'm hooked on the galaxy Note series of phones! My Dad has the Note III and it's even more amazing, but it doesn't make me like regret getting this one at all!! I can't wait to see what Samsung does with the Note 4!!! This device is epic!"
Positive,"Bought this for my grand daughter and she loves it. The screen size lets her enjoy facebook, photos and youtube, etc. She loves it."
Positive,"I can't be any happier after purchasing this phone. I play games, watch movies etc. and with heavy use the battery lasts more than 10 hours. With medium use I get at least a day and a half with it. I like the big screen and the fact that it serves both as a phone and a mini tablet (my kids now permanently are in possession of my ipad).No complaints regarding call quality or 4G speeds. Overall a very good purchase after a long time. Way to go Samsung!! Now only if you could drop the price a bit on the new Note 3 more people would be able to afford it."
Positive,Activation is easy. It comes w/ direction. Just follow up directions. Price is $100 or more lower than the retail store.This is my third purchase from amazon wireless. Found no disfunction nor defection.
Positive,i really like the phone. the screen is an excellent size. i love using the stylist pen. overall experience is great. i hope by the time i'm due for an upgrade there will be another phone like that or better for me. I love big screen phones.
Positive,"I am very much satisfied with using this phone every day going to school.I can read pdfs all the time on way to school and way back home on much bigger screen.In addition, S-pen handwriting postcard is another fun thing"
Positive,"Listen, ya'll - everyone who sees my new Galaxy Note II wants one immediately - even the Ipod people! I am so in love with it because of the screen size and the large keypad. Makes moving about a breeze. If you have seen one/held one, I know you will have to have it!"
Positive,Extremely satisfied not only with the price of the note 2 ($169 the cheapest I could find) but their description said signs of normal wear may include scratches on screen and/or scuffs or scratches on sides and back of phone but it came looking like a brand new phone works perfect it was due to arrive june30-july 16 and it came on July 1st very happy about that couldn't have been happier
Positive,"I knew this would becgreat, yet it exceeded my expectations. Excellent condition, stylus & adapter included. TracFone quibbled about the model, but Consumer Cellular hooked it up with no problem. It arrived with the new KitKat android, so I can use color emoji right out of the box. There is ample flash space on the device, but a Samsung 64gb microSD is also great. I have yet to test out NFC & OTG USB, but this is the phablet of my dreams."
Positive,would like to return
Positive,I love my new phone
Positive,"ABSOLUTELY EXCEPTIONAL,,,KEEP ON DELIVERING TOP QUALITY PRODUCTS AMAZON!!!!!!!GEOFFG VPWIRELESS RESALER: )"
Positive,Very nice
Positive,Haven't had any issues. Item was as described! Will by from this seller again!
Positive,"I love this phone! It's huge but it fits just fine in my hand and my pockets. It's fast too! I haven't had a single problem with it and I know that this phone has many capabilities I have yet to tap into. I went to a store and the clerk showed me a few fantastic tricks I could do with this phone. I need to go back and have him train me on these functions. I love the size of this phone, I can actually see the screen without squinting. While the Galaxy S4 has a smaller screen size, it is really more advanced but this does everything I could not imagine a phone could do. Phablet is definitely an accurate description."
Positive,"I had previously purchased this phone in a different color for myself - I LUV IT!! - My daughter (an IPHONE junkie) saw it, went thru some of the features, and VOILA - a Samsung convert. She begged for 2 months, I caved and got it for her. She's in love! The phone is absolutely phenomenal. It's smarter than my previous Samsung smartphone and sometimes I think, smarter than I am! LOL!!"
Positive,A wonderful piece of equipment looking at others I am happy that I decide to go back go my 1st choice when I was ready to up grade
Positive,"Used to have an iPhone 4 for 2 years.having experienced Samsung Note 2 for couple weeks, there's really no going back.The screen size is amazing for reading articles online as well as for playing games.Now when i see an iPhone i can't believe i used to read stuff on such a small screen.Android compared to iOS is also an amazing upgrade. its nice to be able to download thingsright onto your phone without having to go through iTunes."
Positive,This is a very smartphone. I enjoy have it as a part of my daily life. It's awesome and very easy to understand. Thanks Amazon.
Positive,"Have only had the phone for two days so am still in the getting to know you phase of our relationship, but so far I am smitten. Speedy, power of a tablet, convenience of a phone... Beautiful screen images and best of all so far is the ability tho mount an external drive thru the mini USB port... Having fun with one!"
Positive,I'm very pleased with my phone! Phone is damn near brand new.
Positive,great phone at a reasonable price. I just wish I knew how to use all the available features and apps.
Positive,"Like the size of the phone,the fact that you can talk and text at the same time. The size of the screen is great."
Positive,I had to send them back I bought two. They were in great shape. But not compatible with my Verizon. They were att. Sent them back and waiting for new ones.
Positive,Thank you nice and clean
Positive,It was like my old which I destroyed.it works just perfect
Positive,"If it wasn't locked to AT&T despite what the questions said (I did it refurbished instead of new, might have just been a bad seller), I would have loved it very very much. The best cheap substitute for it is the LG K10, which is a fantastic phone, for cheap, with a slightly smaller screen. I probably still would have taken the Note II over the K10 even though I like the LG buttons more, because the screen is wider (if you look at it in the upright position, not in length or on the side)."
Positive,"As advertised, replacement for my dead note 2"
Positive,Awesome phone!
Positive,Works great!
Positive,I have been dying to get a note for a long time. My fianc√© started browsing on amazon and found this seller. Omg my phone came in excellent shape and very very little wear! Works like it's brand new. Would definitely recommend to others
Positive,"it is an amazing phone, just as described by seller."
Positive,"I bought this phone for my daughter, and she loves it. She had had one before, and she knew she would like this one too. It met all her expectations."
Positive,Nice phone little big but that's why I bought it. Sometimes I miss texting with one hand though. You can make keyboard small for one handed texting but even holding the phone to text with one hand is awkward.
Positive,I loved it !! Thanks !!
Positive,"Great service from the seller, great product quality. love this phone and all its features."
Positive,Love it and I thank you for the phone & services....
Positive,The galaxy Samsung note II cell phone white/ gray . My husband and I are please with the out come. They look like knew. Thanks for used cell phones. We are loving it!! :-)
Positive,Good condition as advertised. Nice.
Positive,Came perfect! A few minor scratches but not noticable.I recommend this for anyone switching from apple to Samsung.
Positive,I love the phone. Does so much more than the iphone 5 love the size as well. I love the split screen feature. To me the phone is just plain awesome.
Positive,love it..
Positive,"less than 5 hrs go by and already I had to buy a new battery. you would think that this much money for a refurb would at least include a new battery. what was the issue with the battery, it was bloated and ready to rupture which would have ruined the phone thus making this purchase useless. so ya not a happy customer. if i could give less stars i would."
Positive,I love it works perfect
Positive,"I am with Tmobile and bought this for my son. It was easy to unlock it following a YouTube video illustration. Referbushed like new phone works great. Not a single scratch was found. It came with no original box but included all accessories except earphones, which I bought separately. I love the stylis for this AT&T phone. It's much cuter that the Tmobile one."
Positive,"I love it , so thanks."
Positive,I order this product a while back and I was disappointed with what I got. The phone I received was heavily scratched and the battery was almost dead. I kept it and told myself I'd make it work because I didn't want to go through all the returning process. Biggest mistake I've ever made. That phone didn't last very long and the battery would die every day and not because it was not charged but because the battery pack was crap. If I could give it 0 stars I would
Positive,Just plain crap phone takes 2 minutes to open up contacts not even goin in to other details
Positive,Within the first few charges the charging port broke! Wow! I was disappointed. I bought an external battery charger!
Positive,The phone arrived on time in the condition stated (with a case too!) with a working stylus. Phone works has a solid battery and was wiped of all previous data. Everything i could have asked for at a good price.
Positive,My cell apparently does not work properly with Caller-ID in South America as the Firmware is taylored for Switzerland! Samsung official service does not grant any solution as they do not have after sales service for this model!
Positive,Awesome phone. Love it. Hard to find good cases though
Positive,Excellent
Positive,"It acts a little crazy sometimes and the battery runs down so quickly, but am working with it"
Positive,I am very pleased with this item. It came as described by the seller.
Positive,battery is so bad bad bad bad. its only works less that 4 hours . i need the seller to send me the regional battery other ways i will return it back
Positive,Excellent
Positive,The best smartphone ever... Amazing features. Initially I was skeptical about buying this phone as it was the first time I was purchasing a phone online and I wasn't sure how it's going to be. But Thanks to Amazon that it was the best decision I ever made buy this wonderful phone. I called several times Amazon customer care and got all my queries clarified to my satisfaction before making the purchase.I highly recommend this phone.
Positive,This phone's a beast!!!
Positive,The Best cellphone I have ever seen
Positive,Nice phone
Positive,I bought 2 phones one of them was completely fine and sealed but the other one the box was open and they gave me an unsatisfied reason and doesn't make sense as the first one was sealed
Positive,"Excellent Deal. Arrived on time, we'll protected and new Package"
Positive,"If this phablet is a gimmick, then it is a useful gimmick. I have had this in my hands for a few hours and I am loving it. I ordered this used and it arrived quickly. I looked at it with the eyes of love, did not see the wear and tear which is not a game changer. The previous owner sent everything with the original box. The first thing that struck me was the clarity of the screen. I upgraded from the Note II which I loved dearly for almost three years. What a difference. I live in Senegal and this phablet accepted my SIM card. I am downloading my apps but the speed is so much faster and that is important because my bandwidth is pretty narrow. I am loving the edge part of this. I use the edge as an alarm clock and I like the 12-hour display feature so I can use it like a night light. This is great for when I travel. There will be a steep learning curve and I will make use of the YouTube videos to get the most from my new toy."
Positive,"I bought N915F version and i received N915G version which not support arabic language ,,, bad seller"
Positive,Nice smartphone I've ever have
Positive,"Thank you, I'm very happy"
Positive,Excelent
Positive,I absolutely love love my new phone. It came exactly when they said it would. Once again Amazon did not dissapoint.
Positive,k
Positive,excellent
Positive,Excellent
Positive,Great purchase
Positive,"Amazing, my father loved it."
Positive,"The battery is very bad. When I contacted the seller about it, they asked for the order# but never got back to me. I emailed them again, but no response. The phone itself is very nice, but I have to charge the battery at least 3 times a day with minimal use."
Positive,Im super happy i would recomd it 100 percent
Positive,"This product only worked the first 2 months and some weeks. The technicians say the device has a fault inside, on the whole screen, it is impossible to fix, and it came with this manufacturing defect, here in America, no guarantee, since it is not an American product, thus , I request coordinalmente, to help me fix it, or at least get paid the same. It is no external damage ..."
Positive,I love it! It is everything all reviews have said and more.
Positive,"this phone is amazing in every way. i have no complaints and boatloads of praise. in my opinion, one edge is enough. this phone is fast and user friendly. i really like the music making apps and all the perks that come with samsung like their customer support, use between platforms (e.g. with my samsung camera) and the online storage perks. good phone, great price."
Positive,omg...loving it..
Positive,Excellent product and fast delivery
Positive,It's amazing. I absolutely love wide screen and pen that you can write down perfectly.
Positive,"Best phone ever!!!!! Love the size, speed, is not heavy at all...."
Positive,Good.
Positive,Came very fast and is in great shape exactly what I wanted...it was unlocked too thank you so much
Positive,Awesome phone
Positive,"This phone is NOT good. I would NEVER recommend someone to buy it from here. It freezes whenever it wants to & sometimes just turns off and wont turn back on until it feels like it!!! It doesn't hold charge, basically just terrible please if you love yourself and plan on investing your money in a good phone DO NOT buy this one."
Positive,Excellent
Positive,Best phone I ever got its worth every penny you won't regret it I promise you that
Positive,Not charging 2 weeks after purchase. ... it is really hard to spend all tht money and have problems with it.
Positive,It didn't came with a regular chargerIt came with an Asian charger
Positive,The camera on the phone was faulty. Warranty is not international warranty.
Positive,"This is a wonderful cellphone. It's sleek, attractive edge design, large screen, and advanced features. Each day I find features that add to my wonder. I bought it in Amazon for $200 less than ATT. It's worth the price."
Positive,I'm very happy with my note edge. I received it today and I really like it. I have been looking for more than two months. And now I'm really happy to decide buy the Samsung note edge. Don't think more to buy it. Just go ahead.
Positive,"By far the best cell phone I buy this year, it was used by a friend who has not AMAZON.COM account and ask me to buy for him. I think it's a lot of money only for a cell phone, but He is an executive in his company, so, probably it will be a best investment,"
Positive,The best phone I have ever had! I loveee it!!
Positive,Its exactly what is seen on the photo
Positive,Fantastic and very nice to hold just what i was looking for. Smooth to the touch
Positive,Gave new and I love it
Positive,"did not work properly in venezuela , no signal or poor signal , had to return it"
Positive,The best smartphone ever... Amazing features. Initially I was skeptical about buying this phone as it was the first time I was purchasing a phone online and I wasn't sure how it's going to be. But Thanks to Amazon that it was the best decision I ever made buy this wonderful phone. I called several times Amazon customer care and got all my queries clarified to my satisfaction before making the purchase.I highly recommend this phone.
Positive,This phone's a beast!!!
Positive,Good
Positive,The Best cellphone I have ever seen
Positive,As I thought of it good system
Positive,I bought 2 phones one of them was completely fine and sealed but the other one the box was open and they gave me an unsatisfied reason and doesn't make sense as the first one was sealed
Positive,"Excellent Deal. Arrived on time, we'll protected and new Package"
Positive,Product came in a perfect condition and is working very well.
Positive,Amazing device!!! really worth it!!!!!!!!!
Positive,Fast and good
Positive,Great phone and I'm very impressed with their outstanding customer service!
Positive,Excellent smartphone
Positive,Gracias excelente
Positive,i am loving it
Positive,Nice phone. No English. Everything is programmed in Korean language. I can't use it.
Positive,Great
Positive,"Literally 2 days in phone shut off saying, factory binary in red letters. Waste of money. Had to buy from different site. Annoyed"
Positive,"Literally 2 days in phone shut off saying, factory binary in red letters. Waste of money. Had to buy from different site. Annoyed"
Positive,"This could have been a great budget phone, looking at some of the specifications large and pretty good screen with large battery. ( Full specs at gsmarena.com great source of info on gsm phones. ) Unfortunately, this device does come with nasty and pesky piece of malware Kingroot.YY which you can disable in the application manager, but you cannot remove since it is placed in the system folder ( /system/app/SDK/SDK.app ) Your only alternative is to root device yourself and flash a stock ROM on it, hoping that your stock ROM is clean and not corrupt.In my case the red flag was raised when my phone kept rebooting into an unencrypted connection. I don't want to name and shame vendors here, but I have a few lingering doubts given the fact that somebody had to reset the initial welcome screens from the default chinese."
Positive,i am in the process of returning the phone it did the same thing with me.
Positive,"Device malfunction.It installs an unknown app called ""Kingroot"" and stops basic apps to run. Restarts the device everytime an app is open.The error states, "" The operating system on your device has been modified and may not be secure. It may also increase batter power consumption and reduce usage time."""

Positive,Phone failed 90 days after 1st use. I bought another from a different seller and it is still going strong.Seems odd doesn't it ?
Positive,"My daughter use this, get in pool, underwater and crash often... work... not destroyed... is a tough cellphone."
Positive,"Product was unlocked when received. Works well. Showed minor wear. Screen chips easily when keys hit it, but I just placed a glass screen protector over the screen and put it in a case. I look forward to using this unlocked phone on straight talk service."
Positive,"Great phone, I use as a back up phone, the keyboard is just too small for a 66 year old that uses a Megs 6.3 screen"
Positive,was just has exspected
Positive,I lost my first Samsung Rugby Pro so I had to replace it. I call it my soccer mom phone. I never played Rugby. . . . .
Positive,So far this phone is great. Good battery life. great reception.
Positive,"The product worked great! Even though it has been discontinued, it really is a fine smart phone. I was especially impressed with the rugged toughness of the phone. I am using it as a backup phone. It's much smaller in size than my Samsung Note 3, so it's much easier to take with."
Positive,"Terrrific but no all that tough, though sturdier. Works so well, features great, very intuitive and get this over the overrated iPhone. Love it!"
Positive,bought for my dad so he has a newer phone that will survive his job and he loves it! very user friendly!
Positive,The Samsung Galaxy Rugby Pro 1547 is user friendly. I like the smaller size of the phone as well. I just upgraded from a slide phone and I'm still learning about all the different options available. For the price and my needs the phone is perfect.
Positive,Crap phone from the Starr.
Positive,# 1
Positive,Phone was falsely advertised as unlocked. When recieved it was locked.
Positive,Not unlocked. Got all the way to Peru only to find this unit wouldn't work on Claro or Movistar. Return set up. Please stop marketing phones as unlocked when they aren't.
Positive,"is a excellent phone, i love it, all that has a phone of high gama is inside of my phone"
Positive,Excellent phone. No problems so far. I love it
Positive,Just have some issues with this phone static when talking to someone cant here very well?
Positive,"at 55 years old this is my first smart phone, I had the other 2 Rugby flips and the were nothing fancy, but great and tough. I don't do a lot of fancy stuff. I really love the phone."
Positive,this phone seems to be as durable as suggested by ads has been hard to find a hard case for itthe jury is still out but I expect that it will preform well I will get another one soonstill learning the phone limits
Positive,My husband loves it !!!!!!
Positive,Thanks
Positive,"Very durable. Interface can be slow. But after going through an Iphone, HTC, and Galaxy S5 (all broken screens) this one is worth it"
Positive,I got this phone for my husband. He absolutely loves it! It's rugged enough to withstand my tough hard-working husband but has all the bells and whistles that he now loves and didn't realize he was missing out on. It was easy to setup and learn to use. We definitely recommend this phone!
Positive,Good phone
Positive,old reliable
Positive,Worst phone I've ever been near since flip phones. Useless.
Positive,did not meet expectations. very unhappy with purchase
Positive,Works just like the old one.
Positive,"this is my favorite phone, second one i have bought and thankful for it still being around. works great!!!"
Positive,This phone was received in excellent condition. I bought it for my mother as she is tough on phones. She loves it. Her only drawback is she lives in an area with poor cell reception. When she isn't at her house she receives excellent service (AT&T). Not sure if the internal antenna isn't strong enough or what. My Samsung Galaxy S5 active works in that area (though not the greatest signal strength).
Positive,great
Positive,"Phone is everything I needed, and the service was great"
Positive,SIMPLY THE MAXIMUM
Positive,Good buy
Positive,I ordered this phone for my Hubby who works in a plant. He needed something he cld stick in his pocket when he needed to and that wouldn't break easy if dropped or bumped up against things at work. Perfect for what he needed. Very sturdy little phone with all the features he had on his Mega and S5.
Positive,Great
Positive,As promised good tough phone good Seller
Positive,"How can I give 0 stars? This thing is a piece of junk, I totally hate it. The worst part? I couldn't have the phone seen as a removable disk when connecting it to a computer via the USB cable, although the user manual states that it's perfectly possible. I installed latest USB drivers and tried everything (even different computers and OS), but nothing worked. Samsung has sort of a web interface (Kies Air) but its Java certificate has been revoked, so it can't transfer files in batch, only one after another! How I'm supposed to transfer hundreds of pictures and videos? So I'm stuck with media files in the phone. There is no way to transfer them in batch other than by e-mail or Bluetooth, which is way too slow an inefficient. I cannot return the thing because the grace period expired, so here I am, stuck with this piece of crap. I'll gladly destroy it (just to see it burning) and buy a real phone instead. So much money wasted! Do - NOT - buy!"
Positive,I am a new user on touch phones. I'm very pleased with this phone.
Positive,Great product
Positive,"rugged , durable and clear calls , great phone for the price!"
Positive,"Quick shipping and great product, Thanks!"
Positive,"So far the phone has been working great. It's my first 'smartphone' so it's taking time to adjust to the new bells and whistles. Seems very durable, yet I purchased an additional skin for extra protection. A little bulky, but I've been used to an older flip-phone for years. It's actually, most likely, one of the smaller smartphones out there, which is what I wanted."
Positive,great phone great price
Positive,"Great phone,absolutely tough phone for my husband. Absolutely worth our money"
Positive,Not unlocked.
Positive,like it!
Positive,Great phone! Works perfectly for our service techs!
Positive,Horrible ...it didn't even come with a battery ... It was suppose to be in great condition ...looked like it was ran over ... It feels and looks cheap ...I found much better phones for same if not less after this
Positive,thank you for your promptitude
Positive,Thank you I have a chance to play with my new phone and its the best phone that i have had everything is goodthank you for the great dealDean
Positive,bullet proof this phone does everything I need and takes beating.
Positive,"The Rugby Pro was much less expensive through amazon than through the phone company. Although it was unlocked, it needed a card from the provider for use as a smart phone. So far, it's a winner."
Positive,Nice phone! Exactly what it is supposed to be. Came on time too
Positive,Love the phone and it was im wonderful condition
Positive,Perfect phone for really low price.
Positive,"I would recommend this to anyone, these are very durable and hold up really well. The only reason I had to get a new one is my inlaws dog ate my old one."
Positive,"I have studied this phone for at least 2 months before I decided that this was the phone for me. So, I did some research on the price of this phone & discovered that AT&T wanted $450.00 for this phone. And now they are wanting $489.00 for this same phone. I also looked on E-Bay for this phone, however, someone always out bid me right at the last second of auctions end. So, I decided to check out Amazon. What a relief, I was so happy to find this phone at a reasonable price, that I did not hesitate to purchase this phone from Amazon. The phone was purchased through Amazon from a store called Cell Source. What a deal. I am so happy that this phone is living up to my expectations. Anyone, who is looking for this phone, ALL I CAN SAY IS: BUY IT, THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO WAY THAT YOU CAN GO WRONG. Thank you so very kindly, Mr. Donnie C. Hoover"
Positive,"is a excellent phone, i love it, all that has a phone of high gama is inside of my phone"
Positive,Nice phone for good price.
Positive,Nobody can hear me because the mike is terrible. When I first try to make a call 80% of the time the first time it says no signal. It is nothing like my rugby flip.I will be getting a different phone very soon.
Positive,A durable smartphone
Positive,After the sims was inserted it works perfectly without any problem . I highly recommend it
Positive,"I bought 14 of these to give to tow truck drivers and roadside mechanics. They're tought and reliable. They still work after water, shock, broken screens, run over, etc. We are slowly switching to Kyocera DuraForce XD....but I may really miss these."
Positive,It came in an At&t box. This is enough for a one star review. Any product bearing third party logos when they were not in the title does not deserve anything better.The title of the product was misleading.I guess this phone is loaded to the brim with bloatware. I'm disappointed before I even open it. This is a bait and switch.
Positive,Item as described. Great price.
Positive,Works great.
Positive,It seemed the back of it wouldn't connect so I sent back.
Positive,Rugged phone with overall excellent quality
Positive,Great tough phone for those of us with clumsy hands. I've dropped it several times and no problems. I'll never pay 600.00 for a phone. 41.00 for this and it works great. Has all I need. BTW I can take the sim card out and place it in my rugby II flip when I'm going to be in situations that a smart phone may not be the best idea. Works fine and the ATT store told me it was fine.
Positive,Received in near perfect condition. The phone part worked great with the sim card out of my old flip Rugby but I had to get a new sim card and go to AT&T to be able to get data. This is my first smart phone so I am slowly adjusting.
Positive,Very good and rugged phone.
Positive,I'm no phone expert. But this is a big jump from my flip-phone to this. I'm still in the learning curve but it seems to have all the bells and whistles it is supposed to have. It seems to work well and keep a fairly good battery life.
Positive,As expected brand new.
Positive,its not work at all
Positive,I lost my first Samsung Rugby Pro so I had to replace it. I call it my soccer mom phone. I never played Rugby. . . . .
Positive,I understand that the phone is used and I hate that it needs a new battery (battery life span doesn't last but a few hours even if it is not in use). It will cost me more than the phone did to get a new battery. It has some issues to it also and very slow. Over all I would have returned when I started to figure the issues with the phone.
Positive,"Needed to upgrade to be up with the times from my old Rugby flip phone, this is simple smart phone with military specs also, it's working great and not to complex to operate. AT&T upgraded the (OS) Operating System from ""Ice Cream Sandwich"" to ""Jelly Bean"" for free. The screen is very good and reads well, there are better but this is good and readable. It's not blinding fast but quick and speedy for occasional usage. I will miss the compact size and weight of the Rugby flip phone in my pocket."
Positive,can really fast and exactly what it was advertised to do
Positive,Had to return it. The phone that I was sent would not connect to the AT&T network.
Positive,"Perfect for the man who destroys Levi's in a month, Justin work boots in 3 months, etc."
Positive,Phone works great!
Positive,Love the phone slow at times but turning off keeping apps logged off seems to be doing the job
Positive,"Love this phone! Although it is a slightly older version, I would recommend it to most people who want to switch to android."
Positive,Great phone easy to use
Positive,My husband loves it !!!!!!
Positive,Thanks
Positive,went through two the first you couldn't do anything it kept telling you that touchwiz had stoped. the second wouldn't google with. a error message saying google stopped. couldn't load anything or search with a new phone Terrable workmanship
Positive,rugged just as asvertised
Positive,Great quality product and fast service.
Positive,Good buy
Positive,Great
Positive,As promised good tough phone good Seller
Positive,Phone failed 90 days after 1st use. I bought another from a different seller and it is still going strong.Seems odd doesn't it ?
Positive,"My daughter use this, get in pool, underwater and crash often... work... not destroyed... is a tough cellphone."
Positive,"Product was unlocked when received. Works well. Showed minor wear. Screen chips easily when keys hit it, but I just placed a glass screen protector over the screen and put it in a case. I look forward to using this unlocked phone on straight talk service."
Positive,"Great phone, I use as a back up phone, the keyboard is just too small for a 66 year old that uses a Megs 6.3 screen"
Positive,Exactly as described
Positive,was just has exspected
Positive,"The phone is slower equipped cpu. So if you running some heavy apps, it intent crashes lot than others. I use it as rugged phone and texting running very basic apps on it, surely it workout fine."
Positive,"Phone is everything I needed, and the service was great"
Positive,For the price buy a different phone. The one sent to mne feels used and it was.suppose to be a new phone. It is slow. The battery life is real bad the phones that cost less then this the battery lasts way longer. Will find out if it lasts.
Positive,SIMPLY THE MAXIMUM
Positive,"I sent it back. The microphone didn't work, and it didn't have a Samsung battery in it."
Positive,"It's ok as a smart phone with all of the features, but that's useless when it won't hold a charge for anything. I did a lot of research when I upgraded to smart phone (less than a year ago). In part the upgrade was because my old phone would barely hold a charge for a day or two with no use.The specs on this said 5 days stand by time (looking again everywhere is saying 9.6 days). I always have battery saver on, close all applications, wi-fi off, ect, and make 1-2 short calls in a day and a few texts. This phone lasts 24 hours or less on a full charge. The other day I charged it around 4 pm and by 9 am it was dead (who knows when it actually died as that was when I checked it).I'm getting a new phone. The last straw was today I had full service, but when I tried to send a text it kept failing. I was also waiting for someone to call me back, who later emailed me to tell me they did but it said my phone wasn't accepting calls."
Positive,This is the second time i ordered this same kind of phone and they both stop working on me. these kinds of phones are defective.
Positive,It was shipped as promised and for the price it was an awesome deal
Positive,Excellent
Positive,superb just fantastic..thanx
Positive,brother loved it
Positive,good phone
Positive,Was just what I wanted. Exactly as described.
Positive,"Terrible product. Bought 2 of them and they both have problems charging (won't charge- doesn't matter what charger, outlet, etc.) Other problems as well but that is the worst one. Both phones have this problems too."
Positive,I love this phone. I have used it for over a year and haven't had any problems.
Positive,Good phone
Positive,Charger port failed after 2 months
Positive,This phone is as good as advertised. It arrived looking like a new phone.I added a new sim card and the phone works great. Thank you.
Positive,"My other phone fell in water and could not be saved. I purchased this one as a replacement to my Galaxy S. I actually like it better. The camera takes great pics and has a flash. Another great thing, I didnt have to sign up for a two year contract. The phone came brand new in a packaging and works wonderfully."
Positive,"At certain angles, there are a bunch of what appear to be hairline cracks in the display (when it is off) but the surface glass looks OK and the phone is functional. This was supposed to be a Christmas gift, but now I have to see if i can find something else in time."
Positive,"Android fan who didn't want huge phone. I also wanted removable storage and replaceable battery option. This phone has everything i need without spending a ton of $! Very happy with the purchase. Phone quality is excellent, no problems with coverage, volume or speaker function."
Positive,I am very happy with this purchase.The only cons are:1) This phone comes with a lot of bloatware.2) Samsung programs this phone to use the internal USB for storage of apps and app data rather than using my external microSD card. I can move some of the app data to my external microSD with some time and effort.
Positive,I love this phone. Even though it is not the newest Samsung Galaxy S; it is a huge improvement over my old windows phone. The internet loads very fast and it is very user friendly.
Positive,"Although the Blaze is ""old"" by standards I am quite pleased with its performance... and the price was right. Now, if I can only find a ""Ballistic"" hard cover case specifically made for it -- very hard to find, indeed."
Positive,I got this for my mom as her first smart phone. She didn't want an expensive smart phone so the price tag of around $125 was perfect. She loves it and it has most of the functionality as my S3.
Positive,The phone I received was not the galaxy s blaze. I received a galaxy exhibit. The phone was not cleared of the previous owners personal stuff and has may glitches that even the phone company can't fix. Very disappointed
Positive,Son uses this phone for two years without problem
Positive,"Bought this phone for my son. Home button, back button, etc stopped working. Phone has to be rebooted every time that you want to use a different app. BEWARE that Samsung does not stand behind their products. The warranty is one year. It has been less than one year since I bought the phone, but they would not cover it. My wife had a problem with a Motorola phone purchased at the same time, and Motorola gave her a new phone with no problem. Will not be purchasing Samsung products in the future."
Positive,I COULD NOT ACTIVATE MY PHONE BECAUSE IT WAS REPORTED AS LOST OR STOLEN. DO NOT BUY IT!! I'M GETTING A REFUND
Positive,Battery life is terrible. Does not make it through the day without a second charge. It broke within a year of purchase and Samsung refused to repair it. Both the speaker and the charging port broke 10 months after purchase. Samsung customer service is really terrible. May you never have to call those idiots.
Positive,Bought this as a present for my father last Christmas. He wanted a new phone but nothing big. This was the best fit! It still works and he loves it!
Positive,muy bueno
Positive,"product as described, new, in packaging. I am very satisfied and would order again. Product works as described and shipment was right on time, again very satisfied. thank you"
Positive,"I bought this phone and I was really excited about it. Well, just to let you know, I was horribly let down. The phone came in a generic samsung box, the manual was a dinky print out stapled together, and battery was a generic battery and not OEM, the phone didn't have the protective screen cover that you peel off, and when you turned on the phone it didn't go to the set up screen as a ""new"" phone should. Sent it back, don't buy from Catch IT."
Positive,The phone is awesome very good. We love it so many features is very nice a high 4G phone fast internet is great. This was the best buy.
Positive,"The battery life is much longer than the myTouch, and it charges more quickly as well. Some of the features are more clunky (like the alarm), but that's more a function of android version than anything else."
Positive,Working properly and has a lot more features than my last - non-smart phone. I am very satisfied with this item.
Positive,"Bought this for my sister who really likes this phone because She is able to skype with it, Has many new features she she is learning to use."
Positive,Within 3 months the phone started to have issues charging it. We had to insert the charger and hold it for it to charge. Phone never charges completely. There is no warranty/guarantee for this phone. Just lost all the money spent on the phone. Do not buy!!! unless you have at least 6 month to an year warranty.
Positive,I choose to rate it 5 stars because these are the best phones I've purchase in a long time. I have not had any problems and do not expect to have any the seller delivered quickly and the product is good. I would recommend the seller and this product to those looking for a good phone at a good price from a good seller.
Positive,"I bought this phone from a company in China. Firstly they omitted to tell me that they would be closed for several days for a holiday and when I told them that I needed it a.s.a.p. due to upcoming travel abroad. Then when the phone died five months later I contacted them but never received a reply. As it was more than three months later Amazon was ineffective. I now had an expensive new phone, five months old and completely dead. What a scam!!!!!!! I would advise against purchasing from this company."
Positive,Ok works good ...the other phone just conk Ed out. Don't know if I'll stay with Samsung on the next phone 600 bucks for the s5 not in my budget right now.
Positive,"This was my first smartphone and will be my last Galaxy. For the price, I didn't expect high-end performance but I also didn't expect that after only four months of very light use, the battery would fail to charge or hold a charge. I replaced both the battery and the charger to no avail. I've since heard that battery problems are common with the Galaxy line so I'm dumping this pup and will get myself an iPhone tomorrow."
Positive,The cell phone is in excellent condition and it was received sooner than expected. No instructions included but my husband was able to figured out.
Positive,"My daughter actually had this phone before, and it stopped charging, so did this one. Joe was quite helpful, but nothing worked, so we sent it back."
Positive,"I was look for a cheap phone that still had power and I forgot about this phone when it came out, this phone is fast and does everything you need if your look for something to get you by for now!"
Positive,"It stopped vibrating within a month and now, 4 months later, is completely dead. It stopped charging completely over the past month and now will stop charging and start discharging rapidly even if I hold the charger and phone completely still and/or nothing moves. Oh, and it also corrupted the SD card I bought for it, so now I have to reformat that. It's obviously been tampered with, as it came ""updated"" with a newer version of Android that it doesn't support. Don't trust this seller! These are not new phones!"
Positive,Very nice phone it isn't as fast as i thought but still very fast. My omly complsint is that sometimes it freezes a lot with certain apps
Positive,"Love, Love, Love this phone. I ordered it because my daughter wanted my Galaxy S2..I am so happy I did. It's even better than my S2, can't believe it! It's faster, smaller, and has pretty much all the same things as the S2 for a fraction of the price. The camera is not fabulous, but for my needs, it's fine. the phone came fast and brand new in a T-Mobile box -- all I did was slip my T-Mobile sim in and wham, it worked just fine. Great phone for someone who doesn't need the bells and whistles -- great for teens too -- my daughter has been playing with it and eyeing it now and might want to switch! I would definitely recommend this phone."
Positive,All the features I need at a much lower price than the new Galaxy versions. And I like the smaller size.
Positive,"the phone is good, and it is compatible to T-mobile cards and the speed is not bad, I am satisfied"
Positive,"I was able to lower my monthly subscription cost. Service in this area is not as good as Sprint. Lots of dead spots up north in Michigan. Combined, the wife and I, we save about $ 25.00 per month with a $650.00 investment. Not sure it is the correct way to go. Would be better if I could take advantage of the 4 more phones permitted on my contract. The Wife went onto the Daughters contract. She filled it up as number 5. I'm all alone on my account. I now get all the bells and whistles, but really all I wanted was a phone that Talked and Listened."
Positive,"I got this used cell phone few days back..I bought it because it's review is like band new or very good condition cell phone.."" It's shit in condition""All the way in bad condition...very very poor condition...People don't buy from this seller..."
Positive,"bought this phone as a replacement for my aging Galaxy, what an improvement!Went from eclair to ice cream sandwich and noticed the speed was awesomeit seems to be a bit more temperamental in that it's easier for calls to drop but I also live in badsignal area.where I would have to wait minutes for internet pages to load this thing does in a second or two.The battery lasts for about 12 hrs for me, maybe a little longer depending on use, i am not constantlyon it however the last phone lasted about 6 to 8 hours in comparison."
Positive,"I got this phone for my adult daughter. I have the same phone, older version, but her phone is nicer than mine. She very much likes it."
Positive,"charging is an issue with this model, its already experiencing the same issues as the one i had previously for almost a year and replaced once through the ins i had on my contract. if i had a choice i would send it back.... the second one I bought in December is doing the same thing and had the issue an week earlier than this one. so this makes a total of 4 Galaxy blaze phones that I have had within the last year that have experienced same problem. love the phone. But this is a serious issue"
Positive,I replaced an older Android phone for my wife and she loves it. It is much faster than her old Exhibit II and never crashed. The screen is huge and she can stream Youtube and Nexflix with ease. This was a solid purchase.
Positive,"I bought 2 of these for siblings as Xmas presents to replace older not so smart phones they were stuck with. They are both very happy. The phones were brand new in the box and without issues.These phones have been mostly forgotten about in the quarterly march of ever advancing technology. That's good news for those on a budget that still want a high tech smart phone but don't want to spend $600 or sign up for another 2 year carrier contract. These phones are still very quick and capable. I have a Galaxy S3 and it's a bit faster and the screen is a bit bigger and prettier than the Blaze, but it also cost me $200 even with renewing another 2 year contract. Open the box, charge it, pop in your sim card and go."
Positive,Phone is great. As I was getting set up with a carrier I was shocked to find out this phone was unlocked from Samsung. Its been working great and has not been giving any problems to use. I would recommend it to anyone needing a entry level phone. It don't have all the bells and whistles but then it don't cost you as much either. Great little phone in my book.
Positive,"After buying the phone I haven't had a problem with the same. It even comes with a card, nice deal!"
Positive,"I purchased this phone, described as ""new."" It came, looking new, in a non-descript cardboard box, not Samsung, without a product manual, just a booklet on Using Android OS. I put in my T-Mobile sim card and it wouldn't log on. I went to the T-Mobile store, they tested it, and said it had two blocks on it, ""non payment of bill"" and ""stolen phone."" I contacted Amazon, and they were great, refunding my purchase even before I returned the phone. 5 Stars for Amazon, Zero stars for this vendor."
Positive,"Everything it claimed to be and do it is. Seems fast and responsive. Battery is satisfactory. Ringer and speaker could be louder, but I've never been happy with any phone in that regard."
Positive,"This phone is great. I got it for my daughter and she loves it. It does everything and more. It came in a sealed box and had the sim card in the box. Buy new, not used. The price is great. At the price you get more than what you paid for."
Positive,Good price. My son loves it. It is fast. Excellente android phone. It is a really Good option for teenageers.
Positive,"1) Very fast 4G on T-mobile2) Has applications available that I did not have on my Windows phone; e.g. remote check deposit, etc.3) I liked my previous Windows phone interface better, but the apps were not available for Windows.4) There are a lot aof apps that are stuck on the phone that I don't use, but this is not a significant problem.5) A lot of capabilities, but what to do is not always obvious. Windowes phone was easier to use.6) Nice size if you want a pocket phone.7) Some of the alerts via icons are small and not easily noticed.8) My choice: Windows phone if the apps were available, but very happy with the Galaxy S Blaze.9) Lots of good synchronization options with Android."
Positive,Just got this phone. Actually two. It is NOT unlocked. I am very unhappy. Please remove it from the unlocked category.
Positive,This is a decent phone with a great price. I didn't expect too much from the price of it but I'm definitely glad I bought it!
Positive,"The item was exactly as described and considerably more affordable that what you would find at a T-Mobile store, that's for sure."
Positive,excelente
Positive,Good phone. after 3 years mine kept saying sim removed needed to be restarted. It still works just has to be restarted several times each day. I've since upgraded to a galaxy 5.
Positive,Everything went well
Positive,Got my phone on time an no problem with the phone either
Positive,"Although it is now dated, this was a great little phone with an excellent screen."
Positive,Worst phone I ever owned !!! The WORST !!! Definitely would NOT recommend!!!
Positive,Excellent value for the price.
Positive,"I was going to purchase this same phone for my daughter at the t-mobile site as an upgrade. However, after purchasing it I googled the phone to have more information on it and found it cheaper at Amazon by 60 bucks (excluding the hassle of the upgrade fees, taxes and delivery). Ofcourse i canceled my order with T-mobile and ordered it instead from Amazon. It was not only simple to connect (just a matter of transferring the sim card), but t-mobile assist with the connection and daughter is a happy camper once again, not to mention my wallet as well. thanks amazon."
Positive,"Great product at the right price for my daughter.. Bought an additional SIM card for my Walmart family plan, and it worked like a charm.. I will probably buy another for my son.."
Positive,"it was exactly as advertised. It came within the promised time. My 18 year old son loves it- good reception, easy to use, graphics for games good."
Positive,It works just fine as I was told before I bought it. It is amazing. What else can I tell ya?
Positive,"Purchased for wife on switch over to tmobile. Did extensive research on purchasing a mid-tier phone that still was fairly good quality without breaking the bank. So far this phone has met expectations. Fast, responsive, etc. Was worried it would be cheap but first time holding, it felt surprisingly well made.... and very slick."
Positive,"Fast and easy shipment. Great phone, no problem signing up for T-Mobile service on-line. I recommend this smart phone if the current phones are to big and bulky."
Positive,"It actually came with Android 4.0 installed. There was no SIMM card, however, so if you order this phone keep in mind that you may need to purchase a SIMM card from T-Mobile if you don't already have one. (You might also ask the seller if it's available with a SIMM card - my boxes said that there were SIMM cards enclosed, but there wasn't. I ordered 2.)"
Positive,"Absolutely love this phone. It runs on Android 4.0. If you read anywhere that it's on an older Android version, that information is outdated. This phone has now been upgraded to 4.0, and if you buy it, it'll come with 4.0 already installed. I bought this phone after having an Android 1.5 phone for too long.The Galaxy S Blaze 4G came out about a year ago, but I don't think it'll become dated anytime too soon. It's basically the same as the Samsung Galaxy S2, with a few minor things missing (like HDMI port). So, if you want a phone from the Galaxy family, and don't want to pay too much, I strongly recommend this one. Plus, Tmobile is currently installing an LTE network, so I don't think it makes much sense to pay a lot of money for the Galaxy S3 which is on HSPA+. The Galaxy S Blaze 4G is on HSPA+, but it's cheaper, and a great phone to have until LTE is fully up and running, IMO. I don't do too many crazy things with this phone, but this phone has everything most people use smartphones for.I love the size, it's about the size of an iPhone. It might be marginally smaller than the Galaxy S2. So, if you're looking for something about as big as the iPhone or S2 (as opposed to the giant S3 and S4), this is your phone."
Positive,I love this phone. It has restored my faith in Samsung. I would buy it again and definitely would recommend it to others. A must buy!!!
Positive,"I was really surprised by this phone because i do not have luck with phones since something always goes wrong with them but this one, however, is really good. For the price and availability you might expect a sub par phone but it is not. It has some very good features as a Galaxy S brand and personally, I have not had any problems with this phone at all since I originally purchased it 6 months ago. Some people might want a bigger phone as this one is medium size but that is all I can find wrong with this."
Positive,Great phone with good features and fast processor. I just hope T-Mobile does not install so many of its own software in it. It'll be great if it has only Android software.
Positive,"bought phone for my sister, she has no problems! had the lg optimus and says this has so much better quality!!"
Positive,"I've only had this phone for about 9 months and it's already started acting up, turning off randomly, dropping calls, not allowing me to deal with my applications I have on my phone."
Positive,The phone was sent to me with the water markings being altered due to it having damage. The phone would not work at all!
Positive,"We loved this phone. It is very easy to use and is just the right size. Not to big and odd, fits just right in your hand and has a good clear picture with a good camera.This was the 4th phone for me before I found one I liked.But this one is great. I about gettingam thinking another on for my dad."
Positive,"It is smaller than I see the younger generation using but it gives us a great opportunity to learn how to use the new phone systems. Samsung is known for a high standard and quality and this phone meets that perfectly. The same or similar apps are used on this phone as on the larger galaxy phones for one third the price or less. That makes this a great phone to upgrade to, I am glad we did.I bought one for my wife and myself. Give it a try and if you want upgrade to the larger phone this one makes a good backup one for later. Go ahead and try one. Hope this helps your decision process. Enjoy"
Positive,This phone was bought for my 9 year old and it is easy to use. It has good sound and it never drops calls. Easy to set up and she get can on the internet quickly. I would recommend this phone for anyone who would like a smartphone but does not want to spend a lot of money. This was a good value for the price.
Positive,"No problem , works great"
Positive,The phone didn't and still don't charge
Positive,Fine
Positive,Phone was delivered on time and was exactly what i wanted.
Positive,"Great phone for those who do not need the latest, but stil has lots of bells and whistles. Exactly what I expected."
Positive,"This phone has many issues with freezing while apps are open. There are way too many pre-installed apps that I would never use. In addition, the phone has a tendency to overheat while in use. The problems started only about a month after I started using this phone."
Positive,"Neat little phone...decent enough size and runs as smooth and fast as some of these higher-end smartphones. Perfect price for this phone I think, Bought it for my 14yr. old little brother for Christmas and he loves it! Phone shipped lightning speed!"
Positive,"No complaints, for $150 smart phone , it does its job to me. I don't know if I'm missing anything if I compare it to other expensive phone. I'm very satisfied, I bought this phone last year for my Christmas gift to myself, and its still working."
Positive,"It's certainly not the best phone and it's certainly not the worst. I'm basically just using this phone as a tester for T-Mobile's plan. While T-Mobile's service is pretty spotty outside of town, that doesn't really bother me and isn't what this review should really be about.The phone picks up service very well. I compared service with this phone vs a Samsung Galaxy Note 2 and this one beat out the service range and overall connection. It even performed better on the edge network. While awfully slow, I was able to load webpages while the Samsung Galaxy Note 2 wasn't."
Positive,Bought this about 9 months ago and it still works great. Super fast shipping too!
Positive,love the phone
Positive,"My phone arrived and from the start it got REALLY hot when it was on or when being charged. In addition to this malfunction, the battery would drain quickly and the phone would freeze when processing. I returned it and went back to my old phone... very disappointing experience."
Positive,"Good interface, great upgrade from simple smartphones. Easy to use. Big screen, Feels Comfortable in your hand But Recommend A Case"
Positive,Now I have 2 of these!!! I love them!!!I wish I needed 3 of these!!!I would love them all...
Positive,"My wife and I have been looking for a replacement for her flip phone. We saw a Samsung in Walmart for $99.98 and thought it was a good fit. While shopping in the mall we passed a T-Mobile booth that had both phones (the one from Walmart and the Blaze) on display. We found out the Blaze was faster than the Walmart phone and had slightly more memory. T-Mobile was selling refurbished Samsung Blaze phones for about $250! We picked up the Blaze from Amazon for $139!The functionality is great, the Android software is up-to-date and the couple of apps we have loaded work well. My wife is still getting used to her first smartphone and all it can do. The call clarity is much better than her old Samsung flip phone and the pairing with her car's Bluetooth is much easier. It took her a few tries to really get how easy it was compared with the old phone. She has about 18 Gig of music on her phone and we used it the last trip when the hometown radio stations faded out. The camera takes decent snapshots and the contacts list is (in her words) ""much nicer"".We are moving up to a complete voice, text and data plan and we will join the grandchildren in the technology we use daily. oh yes, I'm on Social Security and the wife will join me in two years. It's never to late to learn!"
Positive,"I purchased this to replace my three year old phone.chose this one because of its smaller size.this phone is great,fast and great screen for showing pictures.would recommend this to anybody."
Positive,"Its a great phone, it comes with a Sim card to extract files, pictures etc. battery life and speed is also good, it's easy to navigate threw and understand the phone."
Positive,"I'm really glad I decided to get this phone it does exactly what I need it to do for now, and its just the right size. Its a powerful little phone, but it does have a few bugs. I will probably upgrade in the future as long as the phone is the same size I don't need anything larger to carry around. When this phone first came out is was ginger bread, but has since be upgraded to ice cream sandwich which is just fine for me. The battery is okay, but if you do a lot of stuff have or do email it drains the battery quick. I wish it would upgrade to jellybean, but ice cream sandwich is fine, and the phone memory is just enough for now."
Positive,"I was looking and researching an unlocked phone for my husband as Christmas gift. My daughter have the same phone and highly recommended this brand. Now, my husband love and enjoying his new phone! Plus I was thankful that ordering through Amazon was easy and the delivery was fast. It arrived much sooner than estimated delivery date! Thanks."
Positive,I had to get this phone to replace an old one. It arrived in the time it was expected (not a moment too soon!) and it was exactly as described. I would recommend this phone to anyone.
Positive,"We started with T-mobile but wanted to get our first smart phone, but get it at a lower cost. I was concerned that being an older model it might have glitches on the network. I have had and used it for over a month with no problems. I purchased one for my wife at the same time and she has no problems. She is not very tech savvy, and she has learned to use the phone with amazing ease. I would recommend this for anyone. Newer phones probably have more options, but this phone has GPS, and most of the features you would want. For one hundred and a third you cannot beat the value for the price."
Positive,I bought my mother a cellphone a year earlier I believe it was a concord but it ended up dying. so I was searching around for a affordable phone for her for christmas this was a good buy its cheaper in price for most but gives most of the same options and apps as the more expensive ones. I have a Samsung galaxy s2 and this phone has most of the same features minus the screen size and a little less megapixels on the camera. if you don't want to spend big on a cellphone but want a lot of features and options then i would recommend this phone.
Positive,"The main galaxy was way too much for someone who minimally uses the data plan. The phone itself is nice, affordable and I expect to have for a long time."
Positive,"Excellent customer service, excellent product and very good price.The phone however, always stays on (ready to receive calls, etc.) while charging. I found out it does this because it is programed to do so. I do not like it and as it could be very inconvenient sometime however, nothing can be done about it."
Positive,I could only load very little music on it. It was scrached and incapble of dialing numbers when it arrived.
Positive,"Although the Blaze is ""old"" by standards I am quite pleased with its performance... and the price was right. Now, if I can only find a ""Ballistic"" hard cover case specifically made for it -- very hard to find, indeed."
Positive,I got this for my mom as her first smart phone. She didn't want an expensive smart phone so the price tag of around $125 was perfect. She loves it and it has most of the functionality as my S3.
Positive,The phone I received was not the galaxy s blaze. I received a galaxy exhibit. The phone was not cleared of the previous owners personal stuff and has may glitches that even the phone company can't fix. Very disappointed
Positive,Son uses this phone for two years without problem
Positive,"Bought this phone for my son. Home button, back button, etc stopped working. Phone has to be rebooted every time that you want to use a different app. BEWARE that Samsung does not stand behind their products. The warranty is one year. It has been less than one year since I bought the phone, but they would not cover it. My wife had a problem with a Motorola phone purchased at the same time, and Motorola gave her a new phone with no problem. Will not be purchasing Samsung products in the future."
Positive,I COULD NOT ACTIVATE MY PHONE BECAUSE IT WAS REPORTED AS LOST OR STOLEN. DO NOT BUY IT!! I'M GETTING A REFUND
Positive,Battery life is terrible. Does not make it through the day without a second charge. It broke within a year of purchase and Samsung refused to repair it. Both the speaker and the charging port broke 10 months after purchase. Samsung customer service is really terrible. May you never have to call those idiots.
Positive,Bought this as a present for my father last Christmas. He wanted a new phone but nothing big. This was the best fit! It still works and he loves it!
Positive,muy bueno
Positive,"product as described, new, in packaging. I am very satisfied and would order again. Product works as described and shipment was right on time, again very satisfied. thank you"
Positive,"I bought this phone and I was really excited about it. Well, just to let you know, I was horribly let down. The phone came in a generic samsung box, the manual was a dinky print out stapled together, and battery was a generic battery and not OEM, the phone didn't have the protective screen cover that you peel off, and when you turned on the phone it didn't go to the set up screen as a ""new"" phone should. Sent it back, don't buy from Catch IT."
Positive,The phone is awesome very good. We love it so many features is very nice a high 4G phone fast internet is great. This was the best buy.
Positive,the phone shows up under unlocked just received the phone and it is locked need helpis there a way i can unlock this phone for free
Positive,"The battery life is much longer than the myTouch, and it charges more quickly as well. Some of the features are more clunky (like the alarm), but that's more a function of android version than anything else."
Positive,Working properly and has a lot more features than my last - non-smart phone. I am very satisfied with this item.
Positive,"Bought this for my sister who really likes this phone because She is able to skype with it, Has many new features she she is learning to use."
Positive,Within 3 months the phone started to have issues charging it. We had to insert the charger and hold it for it to charge. Phone never charges completely. There is no warranty/guarantee for this phone. Just lost all the money spent on the phone. Do not buy!!! unless you have at least 6 month to an year warranty.
Positive,I choose to rate it 5 stars because these are the best phones I've purchase in a long time. I have not had any problems and do not expect to have any the seller delivered quickly and the product is good. I would recommend the seller and this product to those looking for a good phone at a good price from a good seller.
Positive,"I bought this phone from a company in China. Firstly they omitted to tell me that they would be closed for several days for a holiday and when I told them that I needed it a.s.a.p. due to upcoming travel abroad. Then when the phone died five months later I contacted them but never received a reply. As it was more than three months later Amazon was ineffective. I now had an expensive new phone, five months old and completely dead. What a scam!!!!!!! I would advise against purchasing from this company."
Positive,Ok works good ...the other phone just conk Ed out. Don't know if I'll stay with Samsung on the next phone 600 bucks for the s5 not in my budget right now.
Positive,It's not working at all
Positive,It's not what I wanted it's not upgradable. It's worthless.
Positive,"It seemed like a really nice phone, until I tried to go activate it and it was reported as lost or stolen. Not pleased and now don't have a phone."
Positive,"Phone was in perfect condition, and user friendly. Perfect birthday gift for my son. Thanks."
Positive,"Brought this for my son for Christmas, he hasn't complained once. So I guess its a great smart phone, all the features of my Galaxy Note, he is watching Netflix and everything with no problem. Great inexpensive phone with all the functionality of an expensive phone."
Positive,Great experience have had much success with this seller.
Positive,"Time for a new one, I loved my Samsung Galaxy S. Blaze its an awesome phone."
Positive,No it was old it came with a code I was very disappointed
Positive,works great
Positive,Didn't like it
Positive,Excellent delivery. Just would have like a user manual with it
Positive,"Great phone ,"
Positive,It's not what I wanted it's not upgradable. It's worthless.

Positive,The fkg SIM card won't work in this phone..I want my fkg money back!!
Positive,using now with no problems
Positive,"It was in perfect condition, had to update the software to a newer version in order to download apps, but it works perfectly with no scratches or damage."
Positive,"no because this producted phone is bad and not say to any to the contact from other country, and i can t use this in venezuela"
Positive,"theese products are used! it is not as described, the seller says that are new phones but it is TOTALLY false!"
Positive,"Nice phone, I love it has two sim cards! Very light and quite simple to use! Thanks a lot also for the American adaptor! Nice service!"
Positive,"I don't usually post a review, but this phone was a waste of time and money. The Google Play app did not work on either of the phones that we got even though we did the factory reset, downloaded the apps and even tried using the Google Play through the browser. I saw on another website that Google Play app problems are common with this phone. Don't waste your time or money like we did!"
Positive,"3 Big issues with the phone: No support even on Samsung website. This model number is not listed there, so when there's a problem, it's zero support, so the phone is like dead! The extra storage means nothing since you can't move anything from the phone to the sd card. Pretty slow. I didn't expect much when I bought it. But it's not worth it at all."
Positive,BIEN

Positive,"un poco lento pero satisface aplicaciones basicas (banco,pin,what...)"
Positive,"I bought this unlocked phone for a prepaid plan instead of getting a contracted phone with extra data costs. This works perfectly for my purposes. The dual sim is also an extra convenience when traveling, instead of having to purchase a different phone abroad."
Positive,"Not phone I ordered. I want to return it and get my money back, or the correct phone be sent me, the S-4 is what I ordered. Thanks,GARY D. YOUNG, COLONEL, US ARMY, (RET.)"
Positive,"I love the phone, however it seem to have a fault it is extremely slow and would not save you in an emergency. I will be making a call and it is not responding sometimes until 3-5 minutes. It is so frustrating and I wish I could return it for a different once seeing this May have a factory fault. I thought maybe it's the second sim why it was sooooooo slow so I removed one and it's no different. Please please help me. Thanks. I spent all that money and may soon have to get another phone. Please, thanks"
Positive,"I love my new device it does everything I need it to do, and I have always wanted one and now I have it."
Positive,"The package arrived on time but looked forcibly closed. As if it has been opened previously and not put back the way it was.The back cover of the phone itself does not completely click right into place and always leaves a gap which springs back out each time you press it back. Android on this phone is jittery and gets stuck on a daily basis, even with only two or three apps running and half a gig of free memory, it keeps hampering.I know that for just shy of two hundred bucks I shouldn't expect much but this is a purchase I regret, epecially with the Moto G in the same price range."
Positive,The phone came broken. I had so much expectations for this phone after reading the specifications but I was so disappointment when I opened it and the menu button was falling out; I didn't have any option than to return it back to seller.
Positive,"Exclente, it was what I expected."
Positive,its wonderful

Positive,"Excellent, would recommend"
Positive,excelente
Positive,complacido
Positive,muy bueno
Positive,It's not worth the money. After two months it stopped working and won't turn on. The battery is dead and unfortunately you can't get an exchange given you only have one month warranty after the purchase.
Positive,"I made the wrong choice. The model I wanted was the MEGA DUO. At the time I was buying, I was doing throu my mobile and all letters were too small."
Positive,cakificacion chose this on the grounds that the product is of excellent quality and is fully satisfied with it so would recommend to everyone
Positive,"thanks and the product came to our hands, it is excellent, good design, easy to use, useful for those people who need to be connected with social networking and other applications on your taste."
Positive,"I wrote the seller and they sent me an attachment that sent me to a YouTube video to watch. When I got the unit the closest instructions on it to English, was Italian. The power supply that came with one is an international one with a USA adaptor. It was perfect for me because it was going to a friend in another country. But if want it for the US, it would work but be a little cumbersome."
Positive,Perfecto
Positive,this product was not what I expected as it is a total replica not know what happened because anteriorment and purchased and is perfect and decided to return it to the seller
Positive,"Many Thanks for your I was waiting to buy a Samsung Galaxy Phone, so I am so happy.It came on time, and I do not have any bad comment about it. I hope enjoy myself the experiencie with my new phone, Bye"

Positive,"Very good product, I recommend it. Excellent quality, as it says the publication. presentation is very good, the price adjusted."
Positive,I waste my money purchasing this phone I cannot receive call on both phone at the same time. Also all my calls on sim one does to voice mail when someone call and I always have to reset the phone in order to receive or send calls.

Positive,I have used this cellphone for about one month and it serves well. I recommend it strongly. High price ratio.
Positive,This phone is manufactured in India according to Samsung USA. It has a battery heating problem ... I wouldn't recommend any one to buy it from this particular seller..
Positive,"This phone is slow, can't run more than one app, And even that is like pulling teeth. I had to return it because it's not worth the money at all! I can barely text on this damn thing."
Positive,EVERYTHING IS EXPECTED AS THERE WAS NO PROBLEM AND PRODUCT MEETS EXPECTATIONS MY VERY GRATEFUL THANK GOD FOR ALL GOOD
Positive,"Works great, I got it to use it in Central America with Movistar and Claro and it works great!!"
Positive,great product
Positive,bought in march of 2014. yes a very slow reaction time but that didn't bother me.. It is a piece of crap phone...waste on your money.. It is now totally not working and only had for 9 months max... the battery has bloated... and the back will not stay on the phone.. and will not charge I have ordered a new battery hoping it will get phone working so that I can give to a friend so she has a phone seeing I have already replaced it. It is better then nothing but can get a cheaper phone and works better then this one..
Positive,Excellent
Positive,When this was purchased an error kept coming up that the app store crashed. Not even a factory reset could fix it. The volume down button sticks and download mode cannot be entered even when taking it to a shop that had the ability to jtag it. Hardware was either damaged or never authentic to begin with. I bought for a friend but they didn't tell me right away because they are not very tech savy. Was a complete waste since gapps is broken most of the functionality from a modern smartphone is lost.
Positive,malooooooooo
Positive,"Good product and recommend seller. Really satisfied with the purchase as fulfilled the expectations, good phone, excellent brand as is as shown in the publication without guile."

Positive,"Hi, I can not use my mobile phone because its touch screen does not work and it is a new brand. What can I do on that case."
Positive,i think it is very good cell phone.... i can use it for every thing‚Ä¶. it is a complet phone‚Ä¶.
Positive,Good afternoon I bought the phone from amazon and Wine detail of production as the touch screen goes crazy writing lyrics and dispersed and would like to change that eh could not hope to use your reply soon to see how I do to change it.... thanks
Positive,Love it! Nice clear display; makes it easier to use Skype than on my Samsung Galaxy Y.I'm using a sim card from www.speakout7eleven.ca; I do not have data with it as I'm only using prepaid vouchers and do not have a plan with SpeakOut. So far so good.
Positive,It is all in Japanese and I can't figure out how to set it up. I sent it back
Positive,"I bought one of these for myself several months before this one, and it has worked as I hoped. I have some reservations about mine, but they are all due to its being a low-priced and out-dated phone, along with vintage of Android that keeps you from installing apps on an sd card plus Samsung's packing the small memory with unremovable junk apps that I will never use.But at the request of some smartphone novice friends I bought them this one, at their request, so I could help them learn this new technology. I especially hoped for them to be able to use it for mapping and gps when on long driving trips. They rarely actually used it, so that it has now been over a year when we discover that its gps totally fails to function. I am very disappointed in this, and sorry to have only found out about it so long after the purchase when there is really no way to demand help from the seller. I also see from web searches that gps failures turned out to be very common with this category of phone (although mine has been fine, thus my not anticipating the trouble my friends have). Rats."
Positive,100% recomendado
Positive,My phone hangs as the processor is so slow and it can drop without literally falling apart. I HATE THIS PHONE
Positive,I find an excellent system for shopping since e could perform them without any problems and with an excellent product and good condition
Positive,"This phone was a breeze to set up! I do confess to having a TMobile representative change the SIM card and initialize it, but everything else was easy. So far, I love it!"
Positive,"I COULDN'T ACTIVATE IT, IT WAS WORTHLESS TO ME. WOULDN'T BUY ANOTHER ONE. NOT A GOOD EXPERINCE....SORRY I WASTED MY TIME"
Positive,excelente telefono
Positive,"the reason i choose this rating it's because i order two phones samsung duos both white color and not only one of the phones came in a different color; the other phone came with the menu button loose or damaged, needless to say why i choose this rate and then i called the seller to let them know about it, they told me that i should send the phone back first and then they would refund my money, so i definitely would NOT recommend this seller under any circumstances."
Positive,"This was a gift for my wife. She loves it. Very fast, great screen, and not expensive. Camera is decent and battery life is ok."
Positive,"This phone has being the most terrible smartphone I ever got. Both of them cannot support video calling like SKYPE,TANGO,VIBER.The phones start freezing the 1st day of utilization when you open 2 two apps at the same time or in 3 way call. Samsung need to send this back to the drawing board.thanks."
Positive,Great cellphone a√±os Smsrtphone... good product and 2 sincard is amazing...... Recomend 100% thanks very much Samsung very vey amazing
Positive,"This Dual Sim phone works perfect in Jamaica and as I keep getting asked, will work well anywhere in the world that supports the networks as advertised with the phone. So if you're in doubt just check with your service provider but Samsung wants to sell the phone so they are not going to produce a phone that can't work in Europe or Africa or south America etc. You get what I am saying? OK. So if a dual sim is what you want then I recommend this one. It works good touch screen is sensitive nice looking design and has all smart phone capabilities."
Positive,great phone however it is all in Chinese. I can't use the phone and now I'm going to have to return it and order another one for my aunt. this was suppose to be a Christmas gift and now its way past due. this is not the first phone I order online but the first disappoint experience I ever received.

Positive,GREAT
Positive,Excellent price/good quality.
Positive,This was not a good phone for me. It would not manually turn off. When the back was on the ring tone would not work. It would not connect with internet and would not let us download any games. Had no trouble returning it and getting my refund.
Positive,This phone look nice I buy new phone but they send me use phone and the apps don't work it won't open. I had to send it back
Positive,"the phone seems not the original Chinese version, They received it in bad conditions, on and off buttons do not work, should explain in your ad that is an aftermarket phone samsung thanks"
Positive,"NOT ORIGINAL SAMSUNG PHONE. CHINESE FAKE PHONE. I HAVE SOFTWARE PHONE PROBLEM, POWER AND VOLUMEN BUTTON PROBLEM , AND APP PROBLEM"

Positive,bien
Positive,never was able to connect don't work at all
Positive,"No problem, It's excellent"

Positive,good product
Positive,I don't like the fact that you use date plan with this. Only WiFi :(
Positive,Good
Positive,es muy bueno cumple necesitaba un nuevo celular y este es el mejor tiene la capacidad de colocarle 2 lineas
Positive,Excellent product! Same as description except they forgot to say it is unlocked what it is perfect. Buy it freely
Positive,"Is fast, quad band, It is worth spending on this phone!!The only problem is the battery life, 12 hours!!"
Positive,"This is worst Phone ever made by Samsung, Slowest, dumb, Low end Phone, its not able to simple task, like fast texting, camera operating, or even taking time to open phone directory, This phone is worst for handling two sims at once, Cant even run internet smoothly, I used hundreds of Mobile phones, but never seen worst dumb phone like this. Never Never buy this Phone.Amazon was best for delivering, but its not their fault, because Samsung people made this dumb Phone."
Positive,Phone was much smaller than I imagined looked like a knock off cheap looking in other words the middle bar at the bottom got loose and out of the grove within a week I regret buying it
Positive,SPENT A TOTAL OF $411 AND ABOUT 8-9 HOURS OF MY TIME TO FIND OUT THAT THE PHONE IS LOCKED NOT UNLOCKED. VERY DISAPPOINTED AND UPSET BECAUSE I REALLY WANT THE PHONES. HOPEFULLY THEY CAN SEND TWO UNLOCKED PHONES IN REPLACEMENT...NOT TOO HAPPY WITH THEIR SERVICE.
Positive,I love this phone it all I wanted it to do and more. I have one problem my wife and friend wants one but wouldn't let me order it.
Positive,"This was a gift for somebody else, but they seem to be very pleased with it so far. I can't give an in-depth review since i've never used it, but in my opinion all Samsung Android phones are awesome."
Positive,exelente
Positive,excelente

Positive,excellent
Positive,Buena relacion costo beneficio...!!!!
Positive,Fine
Positive,excelent
Positive,"personally I do not like big phones as they don't fit well on pockets (men love to carry stuff on pockets :) ) so this Samsung is definitively a choice for me. Small, light, fast... love it"
Positive,"i had a horrible experience with this phone and the seller. this phone on the outside looks the part, but when you dive into the phone itself, it is a real let down. there is no front facing camera, just two dots that mimic a camera. the seller was horrible. the only good thing i have to say about this purchase is that i received a full refund after over a month of continuously emailing the seller. don't waste your time."
Positive,I have been very happy with all it does. This is a phone I can see having for awhile. It has been very easy to navigate and get use to.
Positive,"This phone is a very good. I am from Nicaragua and here work perfectly. With two companies telecomThe 3G is slow, but solve with wifi.Thanks"
Positive,"I've had it for 6 months and it's USELESS. Calls take forever to go through, up to a minute...I used to blame the phone company, but how wrong was I, it is the phone. Now I'm unable to hear anything when I get a call. The caller can hear me but I'm unable to hear the caller, not even with headphones on. Phone restarts on it's own. The battery won't last more than a few hours if the Wi-Fi option is on, battery gets totally drained. Instead I've bought an Lg Optimus L7 Ii Dual Sim P715 and it's FANTASTIC. I don't know if I'm super impressed because it does what it should: makes calls and I can hear the caller. Plus, when I dial a number, the call goes through immediately...as a phone should do!! I'm weary of Samsung now."
Positive,"Sent it to Peru and works fine, my brother was going to give it to somebody but kept it for himself, He can use it with two phone companies. He gave up his Motorola Photon for this one."
Positive,"it came on time, I've been using it for a mounth and has no complaints about it. if you want a dual sim phone this is a good one."
Positive,"The battery life, and front cam is very poor. skype nois I do not recomend any one to buy this product"

Positive,"Mis saludos, excelente SAMSUNG me encant√≥ ya me llegaron las dos gracias lo recomiendo.My greetings, excellent SAMSUNG loved me and came through the two I recommend."
Positive,have the same satisfaction as with this model ...thank you very much i love this product i recommended a 100% to everyone need a dual sim mobile ( work very well in venezuela)
Positive,I get the package on Monday 11 May and that predicted from the phone applications Habren does not get stuck or simply do not work and you change the language and it comes in Chinese and the ad said I had 1 gb memory ran and is not it
Positive,This phone doesn't seem to work well. I guess it doesn't fit with the service providers. I am still deciding whether to keep it so see if it works in other countries besides USA but I can't use it. I am using my old phone.
Positive,excelente
Positive,muy bueno

Positive,GRANDIOSO
Positive,great phone have it a year now no problem as yet
Positive,Everything good!!!!!!!!
Positive,"The phone does not load. When connecting the cable the phone does not load, tried another charger and it did not work"
Positive,I bought this and found out that it doesn't work with Verizon. So if you are thinking about getting this one and have Verizon I STRONGLY advise you TO NOT get it.
Positive,"this phone never worked good , it does not read both sim cards and the screen cannot rotate also at startup there is a yellow exclamation mark from the first day. very very dissapointed with this phone the seller should at least have it checked before shipping."
Positive,This product is user friendly and very handy. I didnt expect that the size is just fine and you can carry them easily.
Positive,"While the phone was delivered quickly, the box was not sealed and the given instructions were minimal. Texting is very difficult with this phone. While the ""keys"" are the same size as my previous phone, it seems that it is very easy for the adjacent letter to the one you want to be hit. I initially thought I would get better at it but after a few weeks my texting speed is still awful. To make things worse, the charger stopped working and the only way I can charge the phone is to connect it to my computers USB port. Overall, I would not buy this phone and will probably stop using it! What a waste of money."
Positive,Sometimes we read the review from another people o dont get the product so from my opini√≥n the real true is the se cell is a great smartfhone is fast the pic al most wintout flash are execellent quality the two sim work with company you can answer both call everything is great in this cell
Positive,"My daughter needed a new phone and wanted the same device that she had before. However, after purchasing this phone i uncovered that it would not work on the Verizon network."
Positive,I purchase two of these phones over the Christmas holidays and is very delighted with this purchase. The phone worked flawlessly out of the box and has the same great features as the more expensive Galaxy S3.
Positive,"Put in my local sim card, and works no problem.Not to small and not to big! Just right mobile phone!Need to get another!"
Positive,the phone is very faulty and of no use. its also very slow the microphone not working properly and its soo small
Positive,I honestly don't know where to begin with this phone? This was a gift for my sister and she totally loves it and she the envy of all that sees its capability. Everyone wants one. Its a great phone.
Positive,"Slooooowww. Unexceptional. There was a pathetic lag time on this phone. Even for being a late model, come on. Cannot recommend."
Positive,"the price was great but when you purchase phones from other than the provider site, the phones are not all tat good and i have seen that with this phone. started out great and then i could not get the proper service and it stared freezing up"
Positive,"this phone did not work as i expect I think it's not a real phone from samsumg, I do not recommend it,"
Positive,"Bough it for my mum, is a good cellphone very easy to use maybe a little too little to type the letters when you are writing a text message or anything like it."
Positive,"This phone is everything I thought it would be and more. Love it! Not hard to use, and the right size for me."
Positive,Phone works very well
Positive,Excellent!!!
Positive,excellent
Positive,bien
Positive,MUY BUENO
Positive,So worthless. So slow
Positive,I like
Positive,is chinise
Positive,good
Positive,The phone couldn't be activated anywherein the United States so I had to send it back. I would give it no stars if I could. Customer service was awesome however with the return and even found me a great phone to fit my needs from another site.
Positive,The phone charger doesnt even work with american outlets. The user guide was in a different language and the phone is very slow. I would never reccomend this phone to anyone.
Positive,"the description of items and specifications agreed with the statement made by the supplier, I am well satisfied with the product recido and the time came"
Positive,"no trabajo bien, no lleva dos meses conmigo y se tarda en trabajar y la bateria se agota rapido.. he tenido Samsung y se que los equipos son Buenos pero este salio bien malonot work well, not been two months and it takes me to work and the battery runs out fast.I've had Samsung and which teams are good but this went well bad"
Positive,"I really like the phone,its a little smaller than expected it works very well so far came new in a box money well spent."
Positive,I hate everything about this phone. it hangs every second and takes long to get on..... i advise not to use it
Positive,"I have a question about that phone,I already buying and Receive from you but problem is when I buy I was thinking this phone is new how you saying ?but when i receive the phone the phone is not new and the phone has 2 problems ?1.Battery is not working2.when I'm working or when I'm talking in the phone, the phone is blocked and I have to take battery out and to put battery in after that is going to work 1-2h and sometime when I have in my packet when I see the phone is switch off"
Positive,"Very disappointed!! Delivery did not come on time, when it arrived battery won't work dead in less than 24hrs. after charging it 100%!! Then I need to return the item within 2days as it won't work with AT&T.Please do not buy, do not waste your money on this!!!"
Positive,"Okay, So I will promptly leave a longer feedback message then normal because this phone DOES have a lot of mixed reviews.The phone itself is a solid phone, I had to get it to replace my older LG Dynamic. I wanted a phone with a larger pixel dimensions (Bigger screen) and a something faster.That is exactly what I got. Now, however, if you do not have a Sims Card, you will need to buy one. I needed to buy one because the LG Dynamic -As far as I know- does not have a place to use a Sims, and while I am on Straight Talk I had to order a Sims. The only thing that bothers me would be the fact that I have no idea if a T-moblie or AT&T Sims card will still work if I am using Straight Talk.If your phone is running slow, this is what you NEED TO DO.Uninstall all the apps that you will not use (The apps that came with the phone that are not installed on the ROM).Go over to your Google Play store and go to Settings, TURN OFF automatic updates.--Now something I would do, but you don't really have too--Root your phone and install Titanium Backup.back up all apps that are on the phoneAnd remove apps you will not use from the ROM...Like ChatOn.All and all, I really needed to leave a feedback message on this item because I was not really liking the mixed reviews.Also, if you plan on reading all of the reviews, and you live in the US or Canada, disregard any comment made about Venezuela. Sorry, that has really been bugging me a lot..EDIT AUGUST 31ST 2014:The phone is still working very well, However, with further inspection I don't believe it can get 4G or even 3G.The provider who I go through (Straight Talk) supports 4G LTE, and my sims card as well, but looks like my basebands are not supporting it.Not like that really matters to much as I am mostly connected via WIFI, but just thought I update that I don't believe it supports 4G LTE or 3G.EDIT: June 10, 2015I've since upgraded to the Galaxy S4, the duos is still being used as a work phone and after all these months of use, it still holds up.I've had to buy a new battery however, but all and all, still good phone :)"
Positive,"The phone was tested with the three existing operators in Venezuela (Movistar, Digitel and Movilnet) and works with any 3G service only works with 2G and cell slow Internet browsing."
Positive,Had it barely a month. It did not work properly. It also was extremely slow and continued to shut down while I was using it.
Positive,I LOVE my phone.. it does get a little slow when a lot of apps are installed but all the stuff i can do with this phone its just awesome It's better than blu rave d230
Positive,"What a disaster!this cell is a rubbish.it is really a mess, because we can get what we want (to call) at the begginig we seem like everything is ok but their components don't work, the battery is always warm and each second warmer than tha last one, and when it has passed 5 minutes the phone shut down.how is it possible? you're really selling a defeat phone and now you dont want to get the money, you are stilling my money.i don't want to talk bad about the samsung device, but i am talking about the bad device that i received from your company( it is a mess) what a disaster"
Positive,"Reliable, easy to use, very sensitive screen. Runs everything for android with no problems. very stable and best, does not hang up."
Positive,"Very nice and beautiful cel phone, good quality, good appearance, and great feature for sport and social events, works fine. I recommend the purchase."
Positive,thank you very much I am very satisfied with my purchase I received it in perfect condition and the transit time was in his time. I'm really happy because this cell sansumg Duos Galaxy 7562 is what I was looking for. muchjas grace! I love it!
Positive,"As advertised, on time delivery, no issues!! The description matched the product that I was looking to purchase and met my expectations."
Positive,"the worse cell phone ever !!! ‚Ä¶ really slow for everything and a few days after y bought it, with a little hit, the screen totally broke and stopped working .. NOT RECOMENDED !!!"

Positive,"screen turn black after 3 months,,,,,,,hope i could have an exchange or return,,,,,"
Positive,Got this device for my wife for international travel. It works great and she loves it.
Positive,is not good software is old
Positive,"It does work all over the world, but you do have to buy a sim card for the locations your at. Great purchase...the GPS was awesome from Japan, to the Philipines, to Hawaii."
Positive,good
Positive,I am just getting to use this phone and I am AMAZED at all the features. Dual SIM is great since I am currently living overseas. Seller was awesome too. I would highly recommend this phone!
Positive,I was looking for a new smartphone with dual sim capabilities and a suitable app availability that would keep me up to date with the newest communication technologies. It met quite well my requirements and I'm very satisfied with it.
Positive,although the phone looks new .it gave alot of problem. first it was the screen not swiping as it should then whenever you turn the phone on there was an error message on the screen. come to find out the software wasn't good in the phone. i sell phones to customer and it makes my bussiness looks bad whenever a customer has to bring back a phone . thats wyy it pisses me off whenever i trust a seller to buy an item and its doesnt work..
Positive,"Works great, lots of features, easy to use and easy to read. Got it for my son and he loves it. Getting one for myself."
Positive,I had always wanted a dual sim phone of a high quality and the Samsung Galaxy S Duos is in my view the best option. I would certainly recommend this magnificent gadget to anyone in search of the convenience of having two cellphones in one.
Positive,Used it for two days and charged it over note and in morning wouldn't turn on should have listened to the other reviews
Positive,"I've had this phone for a little over two weeks....barely used..never dropped or mis-handled...kept in my shirt pocket. The original ""Galaxy S Duos"" sticker is even still on the screen!!!!!! (was waiting on a screen protector purchased online to be delivered). Phone worked normally all day..last used it to take a photo..a couple hours later I took it out of my pocket to check the time and the screen is just blank. Can only see the backlight...US$ 148 down the drain..."
Positive,It is one of the best unlock phone which I purchased. Easy to use for my AT&T. Insert SIM card to plug and play.
Positive,Fine and wonderful small phone
Positive,"excellent product, recommended"

Positive,Purchased this phone for my wife for around $180.00. It was not worth the money!! Terrible phone. Extremely Slow!!!! Locks up easily.
Positive,"good quality product, an extraordinary strong team serves well in Venezuela on any carrier, very versatile indeed recommended... excelent phone"
Positive,"nswerHiI don't know about Venezuela, i guess it will work. I bought my phone in USA and the phone is working in Brazil, where I live."
Positive,"Excellent team, something complicated in the sense for navigation on the Internet, because if you do not use caution and use the SIM that you consume is not the balance. for others very good video and photos .."
Positive,"The phone was purchased as a birthday gift and it is amazing. The dual sim capacity works perfectly and the features are excellent. The tone quality is also great and hearing clarity is perfect. I would definitely get another!The dual sim works well, I have no complaints. The features are also excellent. I definitely recommend."
Positive,"version is the 7562L, works well in Venezuela, MOVILNET, MOVISTAR and should work well for digitel. updated version of the software, connect it to the PC right from the start without problems. personally I'm using to MOVILNET, the connection is slow, for MOVISTAR is faster.Sometimes the phone is slow when turning or especially when communicating with BBM or facebook messeger.Anyway, the phone is good, unlocked, and cheap compared to the mini S3.I hope you have served my opinion on this device"
Positive,"This product is a horrible product. I'm in the technology business. It changes setting every day on it's own. In addition, it changes peoples telephone numbers. When I call the person answers and tells me i have the wrong number. I have to go back to my old phone to find out the number to change it back. I'm absolutely disgusted with it and want my money back."
Positive,The phone met all my expectations and I have recommended it to all my friends who are also recommending it to their friends..
Positive,because i really like the phone and the features that it has every thing i want and more this will be a good gift

Positive,"It work well, a good cell phone for the normal use. And the shipment is just on time like they promised."
Positive,"This phone is NOT made to work in the U.S. The dual sim will NOT work on any of the network providers here such as AT&T, T-Mobile ETC. I purchased it thinking that because it was a samsung it would work, but it didn't and I had to end up buying a phone from my phone company. It is definitely not recommended if you are in the U.S, you will be wasting your time and end up getting another phone and having to wait a little while to get your money back!"
Positive,I love my new cell phone. It has many apps and the camera is very good as well as many other features.
Positive,I bought this phone not once but 2 times and still was a piece of junk. First time I ordered it the mouth piece was broke you could see it moving around. The they sent me another one and the screen was coming off. Never had such a problem with Samsung before. Very dissappointed.
Positive,THE PHONE IS VERY SLOW.NO SHOWS ON THE SCREEN THE INCOMING CALLS.SAMSUNG GIVES ME NO ANSWER TO MY PROBLEM.DO NOT RECOMMEND.

Positive,"Bad, slow, crashes and little ability to install programs"
Positive,"I was replacing a Samsung Adroid phone. I liked the idea of being able to use 2 sim cards, so I purchased this phone. The cost was also very competitive. This phone does not work nearly as well as my old phone. The typing feature doesn't work nearly as well. It is constantly insisting that I don't know what it is I want to type. The touch screen often won't work. I have to constantly turn the devise off and on to get it to work."
Positive,"buy this phone because of its versatility. Your camera allows for photo quality, having front and rear camera. It is released and works with all operators. Very good price, easy to handle. It's great and I recommend it."
Positive,EXELENTE
Positive,I got it for my wife as a surprise gift. She is enjoying it done anything she's ever got. I think it is a good product so far.
Positive,"this smart phone is very slowly, and is bad, because you connect to charge and it show you that is charging, but wend you unplug it! the smart phone show you that still connect and charging, but you have unplug it. Wen I turn off, and I turn on again, it only show you the samsung logo and then turn off, I have to remove the battery and put it again and until then it turn on. I really am disappoint with this smart phone"
Positive,Exelente producto (caracas - venezuela) llego a tiempo y en buenas condiciones liberado todos los accesorios buena tienda y buen servicio de envio gracias
Positive,"Terrible device. Extremely slow and it fails everytime.Since it is a Samsung and Android 4, you expect a good phone. But it is not even reliable.Worst phone i have ever had.Don't buy it! I know it is dual sim and if you need, better buy cheaper from ChinaP.S. Did i mention it is the wose phone i ever had? Well, in fact is worse than the worst."

Positive,"I bought this unlocked phone for a prepaid plan instead of getting a contracted phone with extra data costs. This works perfectly for my purposes. The dual sim is also an extra convenience when traveling, instead of having to purchase a different phone abroad."
Positive,"Not phone I ordered. I want to return it and get my money back, or the correct phone be sent me, the S-4 is what I ordered. Thanks,GARY D. YOUNG, COLONEL, US ARMY, (RET.)"
Positive,"I love the phone, however it seem to have a fault it is extremely slow and would not save you in an emergency. I will be making a call and it is not responding sometimes until 3-5 minutes. It is so frustrating and I wish I could return it for a different once seeing this May have a factory fault. I thought maybe it's the second sim why it was sooooooo slow so I removed one and it's no different. Please please help me. Thanks. I spent all that money and may soon have to get another phone. Please, thanks"
Positive,"I love my new device it does everything I need it to do, and I have always wanted one and now I have it."
Positive,"The package arrived on time but looked forcibly closed. As if it has been opened previously and not put back the way it was.The back cover of the phone itself does not completely click right into place and always leaves a gap which springs back out each time you press it back. Android on this phone is jittery and gets stuck on a daily basis, even with only two or three apps running and half a gig of free memory, it keeps hampering.I know that for just shy of two hundred bucks I shouldn't expect much but this is a purchase I regret, epecially with the Moto G in the same price range."

I have two different lines in it from different operators and it works perfectly!! I'm so happy I got to get rid of carrying two cell phones around!!! also the operating system works great, it has not given me any trouble at all!! love, love, love, love it."
Positive,"Have it working in Mexico and its great! i dont have any trouble using it,this phone is totally recommended"
Positive,"As soon it arrived got my 2 sim cards into the device and start working smooth, no problems what so ever, so bu it if you need to have 2 active/active sim cards."
Positive,"This is literally the worst phone I have ever had. It is brand new but freezes and functions like it's 5 years old. It's made of the flimsiest material ever. I don't think it even has a processor. Every function takes forever and I don't even have any apps downloaded! Try making a call -- it will freeze up and dial random numbers or just exit out of the screen entirely 20 times before you get it to just do what you want. WHY ARE THEY STILL ISSUING THIS PHONE? The only good thing about this phone is the sound -- nice and loud. Some phones actually fail at that. But at this point, I would rather have ANY other phone than this one. I've had it for 4 days, and I'm ready to throw it into the nearest Florida canal. SAMSUNG - EPIC FAIL. Don't buy this...seriously. For the price? Highway robbery."
Positive,"Regrettably, it's a cheaply made and engineered phone. No class, no taste, just cheap feel. Besides, Samsung USA does not provide support for this product. Really! Just sent it back! I tried to synch my Outlook Contacts from Microsoft Office 2011 for the Mac, and cannot figure whether this is feasible. Pure waste of time and energy, and first and last Samsung phone purchase for me. Will stick to my Blackberry Torch and iPhone 4S."

Positive,"I purchased several phones on Amazon in June and this was one of them. Unfortunately all but one turned out to be good and this was NOT the one. What happened you ask.....Well...I didnt get to have this phone actually vharged and used til November 3rd as it was a gift for a friend in Aruba. As were the other three Samsung phones I purchased. All apparently came from China. Besides this one a Samsung Galaxy S2 , S3, & S3 Mini. All having problems similar or worse. The problem with this one...For a week the phone was ok....After that the battery started getting really hot...the phone would lock up and then finally would stop charging indefinitely. I tryed a different charger and nothing. I will say this. The box looks original but Im not sure cause some phones are packaged differently ...Especially if coming from another country and/or if a possible clone phone or fake. Im not sure in this case but I can tell you this. When I contacted the company this seller they more or less said your screwed. They wouldnt replace the product said that its out of our Amazons return period of 14 days. They should have exchanged the product or honored a warranty to repair the product. P.S. the package had a relabel of the phone info on the box. I wasnt sure if this was a relabel for the USA or a possible refurbish. I did purchase as new and am EXTREMELY dissapointed. As far as my other Samsung Purchases listed in this review ALL the phones had similar or worse issues. The sellers would not return my money or exchange or repair the product. I am out almost $750. On the four phones in total.One phone was even BLOCKED & LOCKED Bad or NULL & VOiD IMEI # ...this Usually means the phone was stolen and then Blacklisted by the Carrier....Be AWARE of Purchasing Any phones from China especially Samsung Products you will be extremely dissapointed. I did purchase one phone that was excellent and reasonable and packaged excellent as well. Its an RCA 4.7 Inch. It doesnt have Gorilla Glass but is almost as good as the Samsung Galaxy S3...$100 or less. My friend bought 5 for his family and NO Problems. Thats my story....Im not a person that enjoys writing reviews. If I do its usually one sentence. I truly didnt want to say anything but when I was looking at the list of purchases I have made this and as nother of the Samsungs I purchased came up and I wsnted to EXPLODE from DISGUST...So I decided to write a review. Shame on me...and Shame on the Sellers of these products.Be Aware...I now have FOUR Paper weights...also known as TRASH...Regards...."

Positive,I was very pleased with my phone i order a second one for my husband. the only thing that i did not appreciate is my phone had ear phones and his did not (that's not a completed gift package).. please send my earphones my husband will appreciate having ear phones.
Positive,"I bought this phone for my personal use here in US and for use abroad.I must say this completely a piece of junk and crap i bought,the processor is extremely slow the screen get held it get worse if you down load some apps like Skype,face book,or what's app,camera quality is also not good i mean with a 5 megapixel you expect some quality,over all i waste my money so my sans-ere advice to anyone do not buy this product."
Positive,"It's the smartest smart phone I've had...I really love it but I wish it had better range for Wifi. My router is downstairs and I can't get connection in my room upstairs. The battery runs down quicker than expected but I guess background stuff drains it or something. Sometimes it says no network so I have to restart to get it going again. I love it otherwise...very neat, cute phone...I'm having fun with it."
Positive,I haven't actually used 2 sim cards in the phone yet but so far the phone is working perfectly. I intend to use additional sim card when I go on vacation in September of this year. After that I would be able to give a complete review of it. But so far I love the phone. Downloading apps is faster than my Samsung Vibrant. Picture quality too is good.
Positive,"Battery wouldn't charge, tried for days, the phone is slow not very sturdy not a lot of options with this phone. I would not recommend this phone. for the money you can get something much better I myself choose the moto g and am very happy with it"

Positive,"I don't usually post a review, but this phone was a waste of time and money. The Google Play app did not work on either of the phones that we got even though we did the factory reset, downloaded the apps and even tried using the Google Play through the browser. I saw on another website that Google Play app problems are common with this phone. Don't waste your time or money like we did!"
Positive,"3 Big issues with the phone: No support even on Samsung website. This model number is not listed there, so when there's a problem, it's zero support, so the phone is like dead! The extra storage means nothing since you can't move anything from the phone to the sd card. Pretty slow. I didn't expect much when I bought it. But it's not worth it at all."

Positive,"This phone is almost identical to the Galaxy SIII mini in looks and functionality, minus one core of the processor and around 250MB of RAM. I wanted a 4"" inch android phone for my mom and I knew I didnt need a fancy dual-core phone since my mom wont be playing heavy duty games on it but would just want an easy to use phone which she can use to connect to people via Skype, Whatsapp, Viber etc. This phone does the job. Good battery life, equipped with Android ICS. This is more than what you can ask for in $210."
Positive,I would not recommend this phone to anyone. It is super slow and cannot be updated to jellybean. Just returned it for a full refund.
Positive,"I read so many complaints about this product, I was not convinced at all about the purchase.I wanted to risk anyway, and I'm very happy about it. The phone is working perfectly, and I don't have any of the problems that other user have had.5 stars."

Positive,"I bought this smartphone for a gift to a beloved family member, and I must say it's amazing in many aspects. It's reliable, I get surprised that came with Android 4.2.2.It really works fine with both Simcards, the web browsing is smooth in 3G. The performance is excellent and the screen size is perfect for most applications.The phone also came with earphones an international charger and a usb cable. I am very pleased with this phone and I highly recommended it (for a gift or for personal use)."

Positive,"If possible I would have give this product zero star . This phone is very very laggy, cant believe it is a 768mb ram phone, this phone often gets hang .Some other 512 mb phone works better than this phone . Phone OS was of dinosour age . and the gorilla glass was the worst . I could have spent my 120 bucks in some other phone .Whoever reads my comment please try to avoid this phone ."

Positive,"Efficient and great price. It is smaller than I expected it to be, but it is perfect for my needs: I am planning on traveling to two european countries this summer and I will get two sim cards. I already put one card on (Spain's) and it works perfect. It may not take the best pictures with the secondary camera, but it will get the job done in an emergency. :)It also has gps, and hot-spot wifi, which I was very interested in getting just in case the need arises.Other reviewers have mentioned that the memory is pretty low. I purchased an 8GB SD Card and now it has more memory for music and pictures.Mine came with the US plug charger, and earphones. The instructions though are in a different language, except the very basic ones that come in English as well."

Positive,Having problems with phone after a month. I believe this was a refurbished phone and not a new phone. I'll save money to buy a brand new Samsung Galaxy cell phone. It's worth it.
